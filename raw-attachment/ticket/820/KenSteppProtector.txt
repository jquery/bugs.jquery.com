
Private & Executive Protection

I am a professional investigator with a bodyguard and security background. I have friends in almost every government agency in Georgia. I'm trained in advance sweeps, surveillance and counter surveillance of all kinds. I was a professional heavyweight boxer for over 4 years and worked for some very high profile clients in the past. I have been tested and have put myself in harms way for a client without thought for anything other than getting my client to safety. I am self taught in cyber forensics and have worked for federal agents to locate people who pose danger to elected officials, etc. I have great verbal skills and can fit into any environment. I will see what most do not. I am on no lists ,clubs,hold no licenses, or in any publications. My clients usually need that for anonymity purposes. I can pass a background check or anything else my client should need. I do hold a valid passport. High profile or invisible ,Serious inquiries only please. My fee varies depending on the job. Nothing against any laws state or federal. Please do not ask.
