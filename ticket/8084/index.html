Where he describes an issues related to evaluating json, in short doing `eval( json )` and forgetting the parentheses instead of `eval( &quot;(&quot; + json &quot;)&quot; )`.&#92;
&#92;
From this I made the following [http://jsfiddle.net/jitter/vghfT/ test case] which triggers this exception.&#92;
&#92;
How can this be fixed? Either by setting `dataType: &quot;json&quot;` or by fixing the server to return the correct `Content-Type` for json responses which would be `application/json` instead of `application/javascript`.&#92;
&#92;
So I guess your problem has a similar cause. You propably didn&#39;t specify the  `dataType: &quot;json&quot;` option on the ajax call and the server doesn&#39;t respond with the correct `Content-Type` header.&#92;
&#92;
What&#39;s still unclear to me is how what you have done worked in 1.4.4 and 1.5b1 but not in 1.5rc1, because afaik there wasn&#39;t a change which could have triggered this issue. The test case I gave above triggers the exception with all 3 versions of jQuery (1.4.4, 1.5b1, 1.5rc1).&#92;
&#92;
Thus it would be interesting to see a test case or more information by the reporter detailing what exactly does to trigger this in 1.5rc1 but not in 1.4.4 or 1.5b1.&#92;

              <p>I'm seeing the same issue. In my case the problem seems to be because I'm extending my ajax settings with the defaults(jQuery.ajaxSettings):</p><p>settings = jQuery.extend(settings, jQuery.extend({}, jQuery.ajaxSettings, settings));</p><p>At this point the default settings have been already been modified by jQuery during init, line 6896:</p><pre class="wiki">
// Default jsonp settings
jQuery.ajaxSetup({
	jsonp: "callback",
	jsonpCallback: function() {
		return jQuery.expando + "_" + ( jsc++ );
	}
});
</pre><p>So when I call $.getJson with my extended settings jsonp and jsonpCallback are now set which causes the check for jsonp datatype to always succeed therefore treating the call as a jsonp call... line 6909:</p><pre class="wiki">
	if ( s.dataTypes[ 0 ] === "jsonp" ||
		originalSettings.jsonpCallback ||
		originalSettings.jsonp != null ||
		s.jsonp !== false && ( jsre.test( s.url ) ||
				dataIsString && jsre.test( s.data ) ) ) {
</pre><p>In my case the quick fix was to reset the jsonp and jsonpCallback back to null:</p><pre class="wiki">
		settings = jQuery.extend(settings, jQuery.extend({}, jQuery.ajaxSettings, settings));
		settings.jsonp = null;
		settings.jsonpCallback = null;

</pre><p>I haven't spent too much time on this so not sure exactly why this is happening but if you're seeing ajax calls treated as jsonp calls this may be the reason and the above quick fix should work.</p><p>HTH</p><p>Steve</p>

              <p>Some information:</p><ul><li>Nullifying jsonp and jsonpCallback using ajaxSetup as was suggested will break jsonp.</li><li>jQuery.ajaxSettings is not documented and could very well end up not being exposed anymore in future versions.</li><li>There are other things that will break if you extend your settings with ajaxSettings (context, contentType and all the options that are objects and that need to be deep-extended).</li><li>Most of the time, you don't need to manually extend your own settings object using ajaxSettings prior to calling ajax since this is already done internally by ajax in a much safer way (with all the specificities of each option handled correctly for you).</li><li>The rare cases where you need to have access to ajaxSettings is generally to control some custom options you set up there are defined when they're not in the settings object you wish to provide to ajax. In this situation, it's much simpler and efficient to do something like this: <pre class="wiki"> ( "myValue" in settings ? settings : ajaxSettings ).myValue; </pre> and it has the advantage not to break anything.</li><li>Sometimes you wish to use your custom options and redefine (proxy) ajax to implement some additional behavior. In that case, I'd point you to prefilters: <a href="http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Prefilters" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://api.jquery.com/extending-ajax/#Prefilters</a> and to the custom jQuery validation I recently made which provides a good example of how you'd feature detect jQuery 1.5 and use a prefilter or fall-back to proxying ajax for older versions: <a href="https://github.com/jaubourg/jquery-validation/blob/master/jquery.validate.js#L1084" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>https://github.com/jaubourg/jquery-validation/blob/master/jquery.validate.js#L1084</a></li></ul><p>Also, make sure your ajax requests fail without any plugin installed. Some plugins will proxy ajax and do it wrong.</p>

              <p>I've been having the exact same problems listed above.  This appears to be a bug in the most recent version of jquery validate that only manifests in 1.5.

              <p>I know this ticket is Closed. But I ran into the same Issue and want to share how I got that fixed. There's only one single thing (I can see) which was Changed in how jQuery requests JSONP. The Callback name. </p><p>jQuery 1.4.x requested like </p><pre class="wiki">
/json/?jsoncallback=jsonp15108140517397602155
</pre><p>with jQuery 1.5.x this was changed to </p><pre class="wiki">
/json/?jsoncallback=jQuery15108140517397602155_1299152711383&_=1299152711448
</pre><p>which wasn't recognized (due to the '_' in the Callback-Name) as a valid Callback - which of course was depending heavily on my Application providing the data.</p><p>Anyone else who has this: Open your Browser and do the request by hand. Once with and once without the underscore and see what you get back. May be the Server-Side won't get that parameter as a callback as well.</p>

I suggest you actually read comment 16. Let me restate it, once again, anyway.&#92;
&#92;
This behaviour (a json request being promoted as jsonp) can only occur if:&#92;
1) You provide the jsonp or jsonpCallback options or if your url contains one of the callback markers (=? or ??).&#92;
2) You use a plugin that redefines ajax and changes the options passed to the method in such a way that falls into case 1 (most of the time, by extending the options with ajaxSettings which is totally unnecessary and can even spawn nasty bugs, even in 1.4.4).&#92;
&#92;
Would you be so kind as to try and remove the plugins you use then check your ajax requests. I guarantee you&#39;ll find the problem doesn&#39;t lie in 1.5 but in your application.&#92;
&#92;
Yes, the prefilter is applied to jsonp AND json requests ON PURPOSE. This is actually what makes it possible to issue jsonp requests using getJSON with a url that contains one of the callback markers (=? or ??). The dataType of the request is &quot;json&quot;, yet the prefilter has to be applied.&#92;
&#92;
The only thing 1.5 changed is that the default jsonp and jsonpCallback options now sit in ajaxSettings. Those were the only two options not to be stored in this structure previously. Doing so exhibited faults into existing plugins and applications (mainly because people seem to believe it is somehow necessary to manually extend options with ajaxSettings while ajax does it internally -- and without caveats).&#92;
&#92;
There&#39;s a lot of mis-conceptions in some of the presumed &quot;solutions&quot; to this ticket. If you actually take the time and read comment 16 carefully and stop presuming that the problem cannot possibly be on your side (because you see &quot;json&quot; somewhere in jQuery&#39;s code and are then convinced it&#39;s a blatant mistake while ignoring the fact jQuery has extensive unit tests regarding json requests that NEVER exhibit promotion to jsonp), then it will be a matter of seconds before you spot the problem in your application (or one of the plugins you use).&#92;
&#92;
In short, stop presuming: look at your code and plugins.&#92;

Let me restate it, once again, anyway.</p><p>This behaviour (a json request being promoted as jsonp) can only occur if:</p><p>1) You provide the jsonp or jsonpCallback options or if your url contains one of the callback markers (=? or ??).</p><p>2) You use a plugin that redefines ajax and changes the options passed to the method in such a way that falls into case 1 (most of the time, by extending the options with ajaxSettings which is totally unnecessary and can even spawn nasty bugs, even in 1.4.4).</p><p>Would you be so kind as to try and remove the plugins you use then check your ajax requests. I guarantee you'll find the problem doesn't lie in 1.5 but in your application.</p><p>Yes, the prefilter is applied to jsonp AND json requests ON PURPOSE. This is actually what makes it possible to issue jsonp requests using getJSON with a url that contains one of the callback markers (=? or ??). The dataType of the request is "json", yet the prefilter has to be applied.</p><p>The only thing 1.5 changed is that the default jsonp and jsonpCallback options now sit in ajaxSettings. Those were the only two options not to be stored in this structure previously. Doing so exhibited faults into existing plugins and applications (mainly because people seem to believe it is somehow necessary to manually extend options with ajaxSettings while ajax does it internally -- and without caveats).</p><p>There's a lot of mis-conceptions in some of the presumed "solutions" to this ticket. If you actually take the time and read comment 16 carefully and stop presuming that the problem cannot possibly be on your side (because you see "json" somewhere in jQuery's code and are then convinced it's a blatant mistake while ignoring the fact jQuery has extensive unit tests regarding json requests that NEVER exhibit promotion to jsonp), then it will be a matter of seconds before you spot the problem in your application (or one of the plugins you use).</p><p>In short, stop presuming: look at your code and plugins.</p><p>Are those words numerous and small enough for you?</p>

              <p>Replying to [comment:20 anonymous]:</p><blockquote> I know this ticket is Closed. But I ran into the same Issue and want to share how I got that fixed. There's only one single thing (I can see) which was Changed in how jQuery requests JSONP. The Callback name.   jQuery 1.4.x requested like  <pre class="wiki">
&gt; /json/?jsoncallback=jsonp15108140517397602155
&gt; </pre>  with jQuery 1.5.x this was changed to  <pre class="wiki">
&gt; /json/?jsoncallback=jQuery15108140517397602155_1299152711383&_=1299152711448
&gt; </pre> which wasn't recognized (due to the '_' in the Callback-Name) as a valid Callback - which of course was depending heavily on my Application providing the data.  Anyone else who has this: Open your Browser and do the request by hand. Once with and once without the underscore and see what you get back. May be the Server-Side won't get that parameter as a callback as well.</blockquote><p>What's the backend (server) you're using that won't recognize a callback name with an underscore as a valid javascript identifier?</p><p>I think it would be worth opening a new ticket for this one. If a broad server-side system has problem with underscores, it's pretty easy to have it removed (if it's a custom server-side script, that's another story).</p>

An that App I used a regex which didn't match '_' as a valid character in a callback. Clearly my fault since I've written that in jQuery 1.4 times where the generated callback name did contain only a-z, A-Z & 0-9. So it was fine enough to match those. Now I simply return jsonp on my App in case the parameter 'jsoncallback' is set. In this case it was NOT a jQuery issue, but resulting in the same error ("invalid label" as outlines on the very first comment here).</p>
