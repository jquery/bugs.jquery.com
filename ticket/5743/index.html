              <p>In the new testcase <a href="/wiki/ScrollFlickerSimple2">ScrollFlickerSimple2</a>.html, I removed display: none as advised. In addition, the testcase is more simplified than before: It uses only generic jQuery show() and hide() so that is now 100% jQuery compliant; no more direct CSS manipulation to hide and show.</p><p>So I am told that it is not possible to get the CSS attributes of an element that is hidden using standard jQuery methods.</p><p>This does not make sense, and I cannot accept that. In comparison, this is entirely possible for example with using native DOM methods, or using the <a href="/wiki/MooTools">MooTools</a> toolkit.

              <p>Scott, I don't claim that these testases are equivalent. And I don't want to distract from the original issue. May be there is an equivalent of outerWidth() in <a href="/wiki/MooTools">MooTools</a>. I don't know <a href="/wiki/MooTools">MooTools</a> well enough. I don't even know jQuery well enough. But whatever I throw at <a href="/wiki/MooTools">MooTools</a>, it does not flicker.</p><p>The issue is that I use a minimal set of functions out of the (jQuery) box: show(), hide(), outerWidth(), and that flickers. With this new testcase we now have multiple combinations with different methods that show the same flicker behavior, which is caused by the swap() call on line 773 of the referenced jQuery library.</p><p>There is a number of combinations where jQuery flickers, and there is a number of combinations where it does not flicker. This issue is only about the flicker cases.</p>

              <p>The point is, as John said, that it's not possible to remove the flicker. The only reason I pointed out that the test cases were not equivalent is because you insisted it was possible by showing that it worked with <a href="/wiki/MooTools">MooTools</a>, when in fact you did not show that at all.</p><p>I also pointed this out because you said, "So I am told that it is not possible to get the CSS attributes of an element that is hidden using standard jQuery methods." This is absolutely not true, use .css() as I mentioned.</p>

              <p>Scott,</p><p>You, as the software provider or authorized by him, are closing a bug without fixing it, based on information from workarounds that the requester/users provided. My attached testcases provide such workarounds, and I can produce any number of them.</p><p>As I wrote before, it is an obvious fallacy that other use cases that bypass the bug (e.g. your suggestion to use the css() method), can be used as proof to invalidate the original case. </p><p>This is very disappointing because the issue is at the heart of a core jQuery competency - providing a more reliable and simplified cross-browser API.</p><p>The bug has been pinpointed:</p><p>jQuery actively creates flicker via its own DOM manipulation in the css() call via swap(). Therefore, flicker can only be avoided if the caller is lucky enough to anticipate and match the values that jQuery sets so that the browser ignores them instead of executing them.</p><p>Sure, we are able to create such a case specific lucky situation here and say: Where is the problem? That is what you are doing, and this is unprofessional, deceiving and distracting.</p><p>It is ridiculous to suggest that I use the method (css()) that causes the flicker - to work around the flicker.</p><p>Can't you see that you have gone full circle based on the variety of testcases?</p><p>I have now created multiple extremely simple, distinct testcases that produce the same behavior. Let me add one more, lifting the total of failing different cases to three:</p><p>jQuery.show();</p><p>jQuery.hide();</p><p>jQuery.width();// Flickers</p><p>This is standard, bare-bones, consistent, by the book jQuery API use. </p><p>GUI toolkits, including browsers, provide non-destructive methods to measure components before showing them. Why should jQuery be the exception?</p><p>I am suggesting that this issue is treated as what it is, a bug in the framework. More specifically, I am requesting that the aggresive call of the swap() method is replaced by defensive code.</p>

              <p>bht, the </p><pre class="wiki">.swap()</pre> method is there because painful experienced showed that it was the best reasonable way to get the true width/height of the element. Maybe we've missed something.  The bug was closed as wontfix because we don't know of a reasonable way to fix it -- think of it as cannotfix if you prefer. Do you have a patched version of jQuery that fixes the issue you've identified without regressions on the major browsers? Otherwise we've reached a dead end. <p></p><p>I'll close the ticket again, please don't reopen it unless you have a fix. If you think others with more programming experience may be able to help you in finding a solution, ask on the jQuery-dev forum.</p>

              <p>John,</p><p>I appreciate the painful efforts to provide the dimensions of an element.</p><p>Since the beginning of this, when I read the swap() call, I totally understood the dilemma.</p><p>However with the current implementation it appears that jQuery goes one step too far in providing information that may not exist in the browser at the time of the call in cases other than this.</p><p>It forces the browser, via side effect, to provide it ahead of time, and this is causing trouble.</p><p>By updating the browser with swap(), indiscriminitely, flicker is created also in cases such as this where without the call the information is in fact available at the time of the call.</p><p>Updating the machine (browser) e.g. via swap() when in fact only information about its state not an update of its state is required is by definition aggressive or destructive because it destroys the</p><p>current state of the machine.</p><p>That is what I consider illegal. Let me provide an analogy. In a motor vehicle with a water cooled engine, you may want to read the oil pressure electronically.</p><p>Consider an electic circuit with interfaces to all engine functions including oil pressure measurement.</p><p>1) If the engine is stopped, is the circuit starting the engine if you get a request for reading the oil pressure?</p><p>No, because a mechanic might have his hands in the gear.</p><p>2) Is the circuit starting the engine even if it is already running?</p><p>No, because this will ruin the starter motor.</p><p>The correct answers are:</p><p>1) The motor is not running</p><p>2) Get the pressure, don't start the motor</p><p>swap() gets both answers wrong.</p>
