    <div class="ticket-description"><p>Hello there</p><p>We usually like to be quite bleeding edge when it comes to jQuery releases, and we've been trying out jQuery version 1.7.1 for just over a month now for our AJAX-based applications.</p><p>Unfortunately we are occasionally seeing a problem when using jQuery to launch AJAX requests.</p><p>Occasionally a request will fail for some reason (which may be legitimate, e.g. due to a network issue or timeout). However sometimes jQuery will then not call the "success" function it was passed, *and* not call the error handler function registered by $.ajaxSetup(). This effectively causes an AJAX-based application to "stall", as without the success function or the error-handler being called to let it know that it can continue, it just sits there waiting.</p><p>This event seems very rare (definitely less that one time in 100) but can be reproduced eventually by sitting down and using an application for long enough. By adding debug information we have narrowed the problem down to the calls to $.get() and $.ajax(), and are reasonably confident that it is a problem with the error handlers not being called.</p><p>Nobody can remember these problems happening in jQuery 1.6.4, so we suspect it may be a reasonably recent problem.</p></div>

              <p>Unfortunately we've now managed to reproduce the problem in 1.6.4 which means it's probably not something new in 1.7.1; I apologise for misleading anyone as to the version in my original message.</p><p>I'm still pulling my hair out either trying to work out what is causing this or at least to get a work-around.

&#92;
&#92;
@ anonymous&#92;
&#92;
I&#39;ve had a look at your code. It probably wasn&#39;t a fair test without an actual a URL or a cache-killer, but I saw where you were going.&#92;
&#92;
I&#39;ve spent a good deal of time this morning trying to reproduce the bug using your looping approach, only without any luck. But that&#39;s still quite helpful; it seems to point towards there being some sort of rare initialisation problem, more than something can be reproduced with a loop.&#92;
&#92;
&#92;
@ dmethvin&#92;
&#92;
Ah, I apologise, I should have mentioned that we were predominantly testing in Firefox. We&#39;re on the latest stable version (which was 9.0.1 when we opened the ticket, but we&#39;ve since moved on to version 10.0).&#92;
&#92;
I wish the nature of the problem allowed me to give you a better test case. If you look at http://dev-ct.tribiq.com/ajax_test/index.html and http://dev-ct.tribiq.com/ajax_test/index2.html you can see my best attempts to try and reproduce the issue on-demand. However it&#39;s difficult to pin down; I&#39;ve yet to be able to reproduce this at will, and it usually crops up only about once or twice a day for us, and usually when we&#39;re working on something else.&#92;
&#92;

I&#39;ve had a look at your code. It probably wasn&#39;t a fair test without an actual a URL or a cache-killer, but I saw where you were going.&#92;
&#92;
I&#39;ve spent a good deal of time this morning trying to reproduce the bug using your looping approach, only without any luck. But that&#39;s still quite helpful; it seems to point towards there being some sort of rare initialisation problem, more than something can be reproduced with a loop.&#92;

Ah, I apologise, I should have mentioned that we were predominantly testing in Firefox. We&#39;re on the latest stable version (which was 9.0.1 when we opened the ticket, but we&#39;ve since moved on to version 10.0).&#92;
&#92;
I wish the nature of the problem allowed me to give you a better test case. If you look at http://dev-ct.tribiq.com/ajax_test/index.html and http://dev-ct.tribiq.com/ajax_test/index2.html you can see my best attempts to try and reproduce the issue on-demand.

I&#39;ve been using code with the following format as a work-around: http://jsfiddle.net/8gPwU/10/&#92;

*Edit*&#92;
&#92;
We&#39;re going to be going forward with a work-around that repeatedly calls the jQuery command every 5 seconds until we get a response, which is usually on the first attempt, but if jQuery ever does &quot;stall&quot; like this then it means that 5 seconds later the application will continue as normal.&#92;
&#92;
It&#39;s a bit of a hack but it will have to do unfortunately :(&#92;
&#92;
Thank you for everyone who helped out. If this was in fact a browser issue and not related to jQuery itself then please let me apologise; however I did feel the need to try and be helpful and share the issue I was happening just in case it was happening to anyone else.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1328607458801670</span>
