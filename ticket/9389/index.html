HOWEVER, for this to work, the ready event needs to be able to be deferred after the AJAX response: otherwise all we have is an over-architected way of putting stuff in the header during the page load process.</p><p>The edit DOES change one documented behavior: currently the documentation says that holdReady() does nothing after the document has loaded. This is likely a pretty useless behavior, since any call to holdReady still OUGHT to be reciprocal, and the logical expectation in the code is normally that functions passed to $(document).ready() will not fire when there is a hold. Bottom line, it is highly improbable that this change will break anything that anyone is depending on.</p></div>

This is a big deal when using script loaders + AJAX content. It turns out that the change is also trivial: just 5 lines all in one place. My 1.6 pull request ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/371 ) includes the whole change (just a few lines long) and the discussion on the pull request includes a good explanation of how and why this is useful ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/371#issuecomment-1104081 ).&#92;
&#92;
the cliff notes version is that a good script loader is an ideal way to resolve some of the nasty issues surrounding AJAX, widgets, and code architecture on both the client and server side. HOWEVER, for this to work, the ready event needs to be able to be deferred after the AJAX response: otherwise all we have is an over-architected way of putting stuff in the header during the page load process.&#92;
&#92;
The edit DOES change one documented behavior: currently the documentation says that holdReady() does nothing after the document has loaded. This is likely a pretty useless behavior, since any call to holdReady still OUGHT to be reciprocal, and the logical expectation in the code is normally that functions passed to $(document).ready() will not fire when there is a hold. Bottom line, it is highly improbable that this change will break anything that anyone is depending on.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">Allow holdReady() to work AFTER the document has loaded.&#92;
&#92;
This is a big deal when using script loaders + AJAX content. It turns out that the change is also trivial: just 5 lines all in one place. My 1.6 pull request ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/371 ) includes the whole change (just a few lines long) and the discussion on the pull request includes a good explanation of how and why this is useful ( https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/371#issuecomment-1104081 ).&#92;

              <p>-1 IMHO scripts loaders and module loader should be used outside of jQuery. Not even in jQuery plugins. You should look at all of you javascript code as some kind of modules (even one big module), including jQuery.</p><p>The best practice is to load jQuery and other scripts on the bottom of the page and additional script loaders in the head (if some of the modules should be loaded based on some conditions even before loading and are crucial in the beginning) or if you don't have modules that needs to be loaded at the beginning you can use the loader in the bottom of the body as well.</p>
