&gt; Erm...I didn&#39;t test IE.  It&#39;s happening in Chrome 9, Safari 5 and Firefox 3.6.x.  I assume the test case wasn&#39;t even opened then?&#92;

My answer stands as it is! Did you read my [http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8232?replyto=5#comment:4 comment] and the links there??&#92;
&gt; Yes this happens in every browser and purposefully so. #1536 and  [https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/7d02f06e036f6a42ccd2c276e9f00a7cd35dc74a 7d02f06e]&#92;

&gt; Attempting to do this now throws an exception in all browsers&#92;
&#92;
So this behavior isn&#39;t a bug. The error is thrown on purpose, because this is something that can&#39;t be worked around in IE.

The reason this was put in originally was because people wanted jQuery to be &quot;cross-browser&quot; and behave consistently with respect to this problem.

The code to totally work around the problem in IE -- create a new element, copy over attributes, data and events, replace the old element -- is not worth it IMO.

I am also totally OK with reverting this check and letting IE alone die, but we&#39;ve gone back and forth on it for five years. If everyone in the room now will make a blood pact that this is really the right thing to do and we shall never again speak of it, we could set #1536 (that patched it three years ago to generate an error), #5544, #1957, #1359, and #120 (me five years ago!) to wontfix and let the world fend for itself on IE.

              <p>Okay, misunderstood @jitters test - I see what we're dealing with now. Let us put our handbangs back down and chill :)</p><p>Honestly, it feels pretty weird that jQuery is replicating a bug in IE, but I can understand there's been more than a quick pint and chat about that decision.</p><p>The way I see it, is there's two good ways to approach this rather specific, but obtuse bug: </p><p>1. a touch more detail in the exception description ("the type cannot be changed" - I just figured it was the usual crap that IE errors throw "there was an error in the script", etc) - or at least a link pointing to /why/ it's like that (not just to the .attr api docs, at least to an anchor point in the page). </p><p>2. As Dave suggested, clone the element and replace it.  I don't see this as a terrible idea, it certainly fixes an age old issue in IE, rather than replicating one.  </p><p>Either way, Rick's marked it as #patchwelcome, so it's all fair game.</p><p>Cheers.</p><ul><li>Remy.</li></ul>
