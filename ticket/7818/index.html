    <div class="ticket-description"><p>In the past a jQuery collection has mainly been DOM elements, with document or window allowed in some cases. We are starting to encourage wrapping plain JS objects in jQuery for purposes like pub/sub, and also seeing tickets like <a href="/ticket/7500">#7500</a> where people expect to use <code>.attr()</code> on plain JS objects.</p><p>We need to document the extent to which we support JS objects and decide the behavior of methods that don't accept JS objects. For example, <code>$(obj).removeAttr("x")</code> when used on a JS object currently sets the property to an empty string, it seems like the correct semantic action is to <code>delete obj.x</code> instead. BUT ... is it worth taking the size/performance/complexity hit to orthogonally handle something that is relatively rare?</p><p>PS, How does <code>.data()</code> differ from <code>attr()</code> on a plain object?</p><p>PPS, TEST CASES.</p></div>

              <p><code>.data</code> really doesn’t make much sense in the context of a non-jQuery object at this point since it just ends up pointing the data cache to the object itself. I don’t feel like this is necessarily the right thing to do (it seems to me that it’s proper to let JS objects have metadata too instead of just hooking directly onto the object in a way that is likely to collide), but it is what happens currently, and I’m not sure I have the gumption to deal with it.</p><p><code>.attr</code> will break completely on JS objects in 1.5 without a compatibility sim because it is being changed to always only set attributes via the DOM attribute manipulation methods, not properties or attributes. I have no idea what <code>.val</code> does currently.</p><p><code>.bind/.trigger</code> are used for custom event dispatching, even though JS objects can’t bubble, so most of the event system just ends up being overhead. <code>.delegate/.live</code> makes no sense.</p><p><code>.animate</code> works on JS objects as well as DOM elements, and just cycles properties. <code>.queue</code> and friends needs to work.</p><p><code>.serialize</code> documentation should probably have a link to <code>jQuery.param</code>, since that is the appropriate way to serialize objects, but otherwise should not function on JS objects.</p><p>Since we currently perform pub/sub, etc. using <code>$(jsObj)</code>, it seems like that paradigm will need to stick around for a long time, even though it doesn’t make a lot of sense.</p>

If you choose to let data store $.fn.data outside of the element, then $.fn.attr should support plain objects.. it would make no sense to create a suggest $.fn.prop just for this, I&#39;d rather see it in $.fn.attr and document it properly.&#92;

If the choice is to keep data the same way as is, then $.fn.attr needs to be only for dom elements.&#92;

              <p>@paul_irish: As of 1.4.3, calling <code>.data</code> on anything (like an XHR) just attaches properties directly to the object, so there is no benefit to doing that vs simply setting the property directly. Furthermore, if you were doing that in 1.4.2, you were leaking memory every time you had an XHR.</p>

              <p>I'm not sure if this is expected behavior or not, but .trigger() will execute functions of the same name as the event. This can be handy because you can use event.preventDefault() to prevent the method from executing, or this can be confusing because you're not expecting it. I think the current implementation is fine, since it can be a nice feature and can be avoided by using .triggerHandler().</p><p> <a href="http://jsbin.com/enahu4/edit" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsbin.com/enahu4/edit</a></p>

We need to document the extent to which we support JS objects and decide the behavior of methods that don&#39;t accept JS objects. For example, `$(obj).removeAttr(&quot;x&quot;)` when used on a JS object currently sets the property to an empty string, it seems like the correct semantic action is to `delete obj.x` instead. BUT ... is it worth taking the size/performance/complexity hit to orthogonally handle something that is relatively rare?&#92;

PS, How does `.data()` differ from `attr()` on a plain object?&#92;
