              <p>It's a little overkill, wouldn't you say? If an alternative ajax implementation doesn't support several options, then it will break much more than just this code (ie, all the plugins relying on <code>$.ajax</code> -- including validation --, all the ajax calls in the app, etc). It's more than likely that an alternative ajax imp won't use <code>$.ajax()</code> as its entrypoint.</p><p>Also, I'm completely opposed to methods bypassing <code>$.ajax</code> but still using its internals. It makes for very nasty hidden dependencies (prefilters, transports, global ajax option, etc).</p><p>If you really want to go that route, create a helper in <code>manipulation.js</code> that uses <code>$.ajax()</code> as it is used now in <code>$.domManip()</code>. That way, alternative ajax imp can just redefine the method and be done with it.</p>

              <p>I think it should rather be in <code>manipulation.js</code>. It is not a general purpose ajax helper. It is just an internal mechanism of <code>domManip</code> exposed so that it can be overriden if needs be. Hell, it could even be re-implemented in plain javascript by a third-party. Overriding something that doesn't exist (if the helper was in <code>ajax.js</code> and the build wasn't including it) seems kinda strange to me.</p><p>To make it short: having the dependency from <code>manipulation.js</code> to <code>ajax.js</code> isolated in an overridable helper that belongs to <code>manipulation.js</code> makes a lot of sense. Having this helper (only used by a single method from another module) defined in <code>ajax.js</code> doesn't. Adds bytes to <code>manipulation.js</code> but it's so much more explicit.</p><p>Also, I read the OP again to make sure but what I read is not quite what I'm suggesting.</p>

              <p>Replying to [comment:4 jaubourg]:</p><p>I don't think the extension point ''can'' be in <code>manipulation.js</code>... because the internals of <code>ajax.js</code> aren't (necessarily) available there, it's just moving the problem around. I use "problem" loosely, though, because to my knowledge no user has complained about this. But there is value in having a clear hook that we can document for people who want to build a better ajax, which is why this ticket remains open.</p><p>I see four basic approaches to resolution:</p><p>1. <code>jQuery.ajax({ ..., async: false, global: false, throws: true })</code> (what we have now, but made more public)</p><p>2. <code>jQuery._ajax( option )</code> (probably a saved reference of the original <code>jQuery.ajax</code>, but maybe skips <code>ajaxSetup</code> etc.)</p><p>3. <code>jQuery.evalUrl( node.src )</code></p><p>4. <code>jQuery.ajax.evalUrl( node.src )</code></p>

I fail to see how this cannot be done in `manipulation.js`. Any alternate ajax implementation can override evalURL because it &#39;&#39;knows&#39;&#39; it exists (it&#39;s declared somewhere, called and something goes wrong inside of it).&#92;
&#92;
If you really, really want to have the implementation of evalURL in ajax for some purity reasons, then let&#39;s do something like this:&#92;
&#92;
{{{#!js&#92;
// In manipulation.js&#92;
jQuery.evalURL =  function( url ) {&#92;
  throw &quot;Not Supported&quot;;&#92;
};&#92;
&#92;
// Later in domManip&#92;
if ( node.src ) {&#92;
  jQuery.evalURL( node.src );&#92;
}&#92;
&#92;
// Then in ajax.js&#92;
jQuery.evalURL =  function( url ) {&#92;
  jQuery.ajax({&#92;
    url: node.src,&#92;
    type: &quot;GET&quot;,&#92;
    dataType: &quot;script&quot;,&#92;
    async: false,&#92;
    global: false,&#92;
    &quot;throws&quot;: true&#92;
  });&#92;
};&#92;
}}}&#92;
&#92;
But no matter how you move things around there is no incentive whatsoever to use the internals of ajax.&#92;
&#92;
This is all very overkill for a hypothetic use-case we never ever saw the shadow of yet. But for the whole idea to make sense, you &#39;&#39;&#39;have to&#39;&#39;&#39; provide an implementation of the helper in `manipulation.js` (even if it just throws an exception or is a no-op). That way, it is present in the code even if the default ajax module is not and it is documented where it belongs (the manipulation module). If it throws an exception, the stack trace makes it clear that some helper was called and threw an exception. If the helper was defined in `ajax.js`, in a build without `ajax.js`, the stack trace would indicate that domManip called something that doesn&#39;t exist. As a dev, I much prefer the former as it makes it clear the helper is supposed to exist in the first place but that something went wrong within it.&#92;
&#92;
Let me re-assert that this helper has no use whatsoever outside of `domManip` and that we&#39;re talking about exposing it solely in order to make it overridable (it should probably be `_evalURL` to make it clear it&#39;s just some internal stuff exposed btw). As such, the idea of having it buried inside `ajax.js` while it doesn&#39;t even need access to any of its internals doesn&#39;t make any kind of sense.&#92;

              <blockquote> we're talking about exposing it solely in order to make it overridable (it should probably be _evalURL to make it clear it's just some internal stuff exposed btw).</blockquote><p>Agreed with both of these. The reason I'd advocate putting the method in ajax.js is because if it is overridden there is no reason for the original implementation to be in manipulation.js. The standard implementation uses $.ajax so if $.ajax is missing you wouldn't want the standard implementation to be present.</p>

              <p>I'm increasingly in favor of leaving the code as-is and requiring ajax implementations to support <code>{ async: false, global: false, throws: true }</code> for full functionality in manipulation. It uses whatever <code>ajax</code> is defined, failing meaningfully when there isn't one. The only potential benefit we would get from an <code>evalURL</code> is using our pre-override <code>ajax</code>, then only if a replacement masks errors or doesn't support synchronous calls. After all, it's just as easy to support those options as it is to override another method.</p><p>Are there any objections to a no-change "fix"?</p>

              <p>Well I was thinking that most alternative "ajax" implementations would not try to emulate the <code>$.ajax()</code> API because that would be very difficult to subset in a reliable way. Any code that sees a <code>$.ajax</code> entry point is probably going to assume the whole implementation is there.</p><p>My typical example is an app that only needs JSONP so it would exclude ajax.js and instead use something like jaubourg's <code>$.jsonp</code> plugin. They might call <code>$.getJSON</code> within the app itself but wouldn't implement <code>$.ajax</code>. They could certainly override an implementation placed in manipulation.js (or even let it error out if they didn't need scripts in their HTML) but in that case it would have been nice to have that implementation in ajax.js so it wouldn't be taking up bytes in the build.</p>
