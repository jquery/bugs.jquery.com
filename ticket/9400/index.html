              <p>+1, But if we remove this, we have to doc the hell out of it and make it fail obtrusively, kind of like when @ got deprecated - and we have to make the case that just like dropping @, it's a simple code change and it makes your code go faster.  And also provide a shim. These shortcuts are really popular.</p>

              <p>Right, I agree it *can* be done in HTML; the question is whether it *should* be done. Give me the standard CSS to select only <code>&lt;input /&gt;</code> and not <code>&lt;input type=checkbox&gt;</code> in order to style it, for example. Whatever that is, you can use it in jQuery as well. If it turns out to be difficult, then perhaps inputs without a type are possible, but not advisable. Therefore the deprecation. It doesn't mean you cannot do it, just that it is not a good idea.</p>

              <p>I see this deprecation is part of 1.8 release - the point about the value of ":text" because "text" is the default for "type" in HTML5 seems very relevant.</p><p>The discussion kind of died out and suddenly it's official, just wondering what the proposed "correct" way to select text inputs is now. Is it expected that the "type" element should be included no matter what, even though it's not required in HTML5, or would we be expected to use a selector that chooses type="text" or type is missing to properly select all text inputs from a valid HTML5 document? Honestly I can't even figure out a CSS selector that would work inline. You could say:</p><p>    input[type="text"], input[type!=""]</p><p>.. but that doesn't work inline (it would have to be it's own selector, since it depends on grouping for an "or" condition). And it's ugly as sin. And even that requires the jQuery "attribute not equals" extension!</p><p>This seems a very useful, and probably very widely used, feature to deprecate, without providing a clear path for an alternative.</p>

              <p>I think the best approach is to specify the <code>type</code> in the markup. Otherwise it can't be selected with CSS either. As with methods like <code>.live()</code> there is no set time for removing these, and some or all of them may not ever be removed. By deprecating them we are making it clear these are non-standard and not advisable.</p>

Quite the opposite, it seems like an excellent reason for the inclusion of a feature. </p><p>":selected" does something that can't be done at all with CSS. So does ":input" (at least not inline). So does attribute !=. Aren't these useful features for that very reason? This seems like a step backwards. I like the fact that jQuery solves shortcomings of the browser & CSS. I realize that this isn't going to break anything today, or for some time, but whenever that feature is removed it sure will. This seems like something that's way too common, and involves a requirement to make changes to 100% valid HTML, to be removed.</p>

              <p>Sure, I understand - but it's kinda the same thing. The goal of deprecating something is to remove it, and I wouldn't want to code against a deprecated feature if I could help it.</p><p>If the rationale is ensuring that whatever works with jQuery can also be done directly with CSS, does that mean that all other non-CSS pseudoclass selectors are likely to be deprecated in the future? Like :has(), :parent, :selected, and so on?</p><p>I'm just trying to understand the direction and rationale here. If the eventual target is to no longer support any non-true-CSS selectors (e.g. removing all jQuery extensions, in favor of only supporting the CSS4 spec) then that's fine, but that seems like a pretty big philosophical change to jQuery. CSS4 does deal with some stuff that jQuery extensions covered, but not everything, like this one and :selected, but probably others too.</p>

              <p>I read:</p><blockquote> Right, I agree it *can* be done in HTML; the question is whether it *should* be done. Give me the standard CSS to  select only &lt;input /&gt; and not &lt;input type=checkbox&gt; in order to style it, for example. Whatever that is, you can  use it in jQuery as well. If it turns out to be difficult, then perhaps inputs without a type are possible, but not  advisable. Therefore the deprecation. It doesn't mean you cannot do it, just that it is not a good idea.</blockquote><p>as advising people not to use inputs without a type.  If I misunderstood, I did not mean to "spew".  I meant to refer to your posts to say that I disagree and think that people should be able leave out the type attribute on input elements.</p><p>We have an internal library that is used to read from form inputs, and ran into a bug where all of a sudden text inputs where not being selected properly.  This was due to turning on the elide attributes optimization.  We put in a fix to use the :text pseudo-selector instead, and found that to be a nicely elegant fix.  While I agree that some of the other pseudo selectors, like :checkbox and :radio don't really do much useful "work", :text seems to do a very valuable normalization.</p><p>We also ended up implementing a filter that looked for all text-like inputs at once.  This one then selected HTML5 variants like [type=search],[type=email],[type=tel], etc.  I wonder if maybe a :text-like pseudo-selector might be useful to put in as a feature.</p>

It would seem just as performance-inefficient to do <strong>$($("#myForm").elements)</strong> in order to get the inputs into a jQuery object.

To get help with traversal, filtering, or writing a plugin, ask a question on our forum or <a href="/wiki/StackOverflow">StackOverflow</a>.</blockquote><p>i disagree.</p><p>The purpose of my comments was to pose an argument against deprecating this particular selector until/unless an equally <em>effective</em> & <em>simple-to-use</em> alternative is offered. So far, i'm not convinced the suggestions match those requirements, which are fundamental qualities of jQuery.</p><p><code>.filter()</code> doesn't help unless the INPUT/etc. elements are already in the collection, in which case you're in the same boat as above: using a long selector to get them or wrapping the DOM <code>form.elements</code> which someone suggested may cause problems in old IE. If you meant <code>.find()</code>, you still start from the FORM and feed a long selector to get the full list of elements.</p><p>So it goes back to: This selector provides an EASY way to get all the inputs of a form, regardless of <em>tag</em>, but it hurts performance. On the other hand, the alternatives are either inconvenient or perform as badly as this selector. Weighed against each other, i say the ease of use wins and the selector should be kept.</p><p>i personally feel adding a method to replace this wouldn't be that harmful. It would use <code>.find()</code>, but would handle the long selector internally. Optionally, if a selector is passed to it, that would filter <code>.find()</code>'s results. The resulting executions should wash:</p><p>Let's assume a requirement to obtain all inputs of a form, no immediate filters (which is what this selector does in the first place).</p><pre class="wiki">
/* Current (lack-of) alternative */
$("#myForm").find("input, select, textarea, button")
==
$("#myForm").inputs() /* inputs() handles the above selector */

/* Optional filtering argument */
$("#myForm").find("input, select, textarea, button").filter("[name^=foo]")
==
$("#myForm").inputs("[name^=foo]") /* inputs() handles the selector & filters */
</pre><p>So to emphasize the point: this feature impacts performance but keeps code simple. If it's removed, the alternatives offered improve performance, but do not retain simplicity.</p>

The best way to prove the demand is to release a plugin and then there's an implementation with its pros and cons we can evaluate, as well as the plugin's level of adoption.  This isn't the first time someone's wanted a traversal/filtering method that would make life easier, and it likely won't be the last. However,  something like this to core right now, especially when it could be fraught with issues in oldIE, isn't something we want to take on.  And again, :input isn't going anywhere, we just want to make the point that just because something is a little faster to type, it doesn't make it the best choice for your application.</p>

In any case, while i completely agree the non-standard type selectors should go, <code>:input</code> will be hard to get rid of without a suitable replacement. In the meantime, the whole block of code that deals with these selectors is stuck in the core, so i figured a replacement method might ease its removal. :)</p><p>Thanks for the feedback.</p>
