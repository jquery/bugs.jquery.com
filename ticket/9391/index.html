              <p>@rob, yes I understood that, but the proposal indicates a misunderstanding of how selectors work. The proposal seems to assume that selectors are evaluated from right-to-left, when they're actually evaluated left to right - which makes a huge difference in how your proposal is interpreted. </p>
