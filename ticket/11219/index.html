    <div class="ticket-description"><p>I found that there is a very easy way to make the browser hang in an infinite loop using latest jQuery. To do that, you need to pass an object containing a jQuery collection to $.param.</p><p>The way I found it is that I wasn't aware that $.fn.map returns a jQuery collection, and I was passing it to $.post as data. This code has worked fine before on jQuery 1.4.2, and then stopped working when I've upgraded jQuery to 1.7.1.</p><p>Here's a JSFiddle test with an example: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/gfzSU/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/gfzSU/</a> - if you run it as is and click the button, it will just hang. This must have been changed somewhere between 1.4.4 and 1.5.2, because it works on 1.4.4 and starts behaving like this on 1.5.2.</p></div>

              <p>That is a big amount of code for a bug that should be found before the page is deployed. I agree that theoretically it would be great to diagnose and clearly explain every misuse of the API with a good error message, but it just has too high a cost.</p>

              <p>jQuery.param is meant to be used for serializing objects that will be sent to a server - it should be assumed that this means it is limited to circular reference safe values. It's smarter to write code that doesn't make this mistake, then to modify jQuery core and burden all it's other users with the additional file size.</p>

              <p>I might be biased here, but I'd say it's rather easy to cause this error, because jQuery collections behave just like arrays in most cases (if you print them in the console you can't see any difference), and you might not notice that the thing you got from map() and looks like an array of integers is not a real array. It wouldn't even have to check for every possible circular reference, just if there aren't any jQuery collections inside the passed object, if they are known to be a problem in this case.</p><p>Also, hanging the browser is a pretty brutal reaction, most errors that you can generate for using the API in a wrong way result in either an exception (with stack trace and/or other details) or nothing happening at all when it should have.</p>
