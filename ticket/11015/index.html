              <p>Our current plan is to put CCAO in a branch based on the final 1.8. The team consensus is that the jsdoc comments and in particular the inline type annotations make the code much less readable. Some of the CCAO code changes may be pulled into master, but in total they are 200 bytes so it's unlikely we will pull them all in. </p><p>For this to progress further after 1.8, we will require community assistance to help maintain CCAO compatibility and provide help for users wanting to build their own projects with jQuery and CCAO (see the task list above). If there is sufficient interest and participation, we will consider further integration.</p>

              <p>+1, I've been waiting for this capability for a long while, so it's great to see that it's in progress.</p><p>However, I think it's a mistake to put it on a separate branch, specially because of a 200 bytes size increase; in my opinion, a user that cares about 200 bytes increase will definitely consider using something ADVANCED_OPTIMIZATIONS to save kbs; in most scenarios, the websites only use a portion of the full JQuery functionality.</p><p>Also, if this is aimed at power users, I don't see the point of task <a href="/ticket/5">#5</a>; this process can be done with tools that already exist (i.e. Apache Ant), so maybe sample scripts would suffice, instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>

              <p>@joseprio, it's not just the 200 bytes, it is the increase in noise in the source code and an ongoing responsibility to maintain CCAO compatibility once we've merged it into master. </p><p>Any large <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> code base is not going to get that much smaller unless the entire thing can be compiled via CCAO. Having jQuery Core at that point is a good first step, but not very useful unless the user's own code, third-party jQuery plugins, jQuery UI, jQuery Mobile, Backbone.js, Ember.js, etc are also CCAO-safe.</p><p>If you and other CCAO users are interested in stepping up and maintaining / testing / documenting / evangelizing its use with jQuery 1.8 and the rest of the <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> ecosystem, we welcome it! That's the best way to guarantee that jQuery maintains CCAO compatibility into the future.</p>
