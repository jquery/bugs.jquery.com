The sequence of events triggered varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two click events and others only one. If an interface that reacts differently to single- and double-clicks cannot be avoided, then the dblclick event should be simulated within the click handler. We can achieve this by saving a timestamp in the handler, and then comparing the current time to the saved timestamp on subsequent clicks. If the difference is small enough, we can treat the click as a double-click. </pre><p>In IE (8 at least) however, the second click even is not fired, only the first click, then a dblclick.</p><p><a href="http://www.jsfiddle.net/b4ktR/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://www.jsfiddle.net/b4ktR/</a></p><p>The best solution I have come up with is to use the timer as proposed, but if a dblclick event is fired, have it do what the timer would do in the case of a dblclick, cancel the timer, and return false;  There is probably a better way, but that what I have right now.</p><p>Sorry if this is not the best place to post a documentation issue.</p></div>

              <p>Unless I am missing something and just being an idiot (quite possible), if I only have a click handler, and the browser fires a click and then a dblclick, checking the time between click will do no good, as the second click will be ignored because I have nothing bound to dblclick.  ''The second click event is not fired even if no event is bound to dblclick.''  </p><p>If instead I have something bound to click that does the time checking, and something bound to dblclick for the browsers that use only it, I will be double firing my dblclick in browsers that give me two clicks and a dblclick.</p><blockquote> It's a really bad idea to use double clicks in a web interface, it's not something that most people expect. </blockquote><p>I totally agree with that, however, if the docs propose a possible solution, I feel it should work, or not be provided.</p><p>I think the docs would be better if they did one of the following:</p><p>1.

The sequence of events triggered varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two click and one dblclick event and others only a single click and dblclick event.  You can get around this by checking the time between click/dblclick events, and manually firing your event when appropriate.</blockquote><p>3. Providing a solid method to make it work.  I do not have a good example for how to do this.

              <p>Ah, okay, I see what you are saying. The docs wording is ambiguous. I think it essentially means "making an element respond to both click and double-click is not a good idea. But you forge ahead and do it anyway, the solution may involve attaching both a click and double-click handler so it can work on all browsers." Does that sound right?</p><p>I think it may be best to remove any prescriptive attempt at a solution here, so that's what I've done. There is a user comment on the page that includes a link with code, in case anyone wants to do it.</p>
