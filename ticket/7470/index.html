Now this has been tested in Safari, Google Chrome, IE9, IE8*, IE7*, Firefox 3, Firefox 4&#92;
* = error is created&#92;
&#92;
For some reason the code is not saving as it should be and does in other browsers&#92;
&#92;
Ths code is supposed to read the elements of a list, delete them and add them as needed the problem is the elemenets are not being saved into the op._elements array or read from it correctly. as it is not placing the data into the output zone correctly.&#92;

&#92;
Was that hard all i have done is removed the click evens and the users error checking as if you could flaming read you would see &#92;
&#92;
&quot;problem is the elements are not being saved into the op._elements array or read from it correctly&quot;&#92;
&#92;
&#92;
Which means I told you it was on the code&#39;s execution. so if any one looked that the code they could have seen all the needed to do was remove the click event, as I have updated for you its code size is &#92;
&#92;
As to the use of $() I no it does not link to the document I know and don&#39;t want it to I just want to access the jQuery Core not an element though the core.&#92;
&#92;
So you experts in jQuery programming it for years if complete bull shit as they don&#39;t know much about it!&#92;

              <p>@martin</p><p>I must say I have seldom encountered someone like you. Who simply is unwilling to follow <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/How_to_Report_Bugs" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>How to report bugs</a> and provide a reduced test case. Instead you start insulting the staff because we don't debug a cross-browser issue in a code pile of yours. It's nothing uncommon that some code works in most browsers but not IE. This has nothing to do with jQuery. If it breaks in IE the cause is most likely IE.</p><p>Until proven otherwise you should have reduced to find out what/where it breaks in IE and then check if it's something jQuery needs to workaround or doesn't.</p><p>So hadn't you been too lazy to do that you would have come up with this <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/jitter/5jBuH/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>test case</a>. This is also a nice example what we understand by reduced test case (6 lines of js and a bit of markup).</p><p>So here we can see that IE looses the reference to the contents of the li's when setting the innerHTML of the ul (all other browsers don't). So this isn't a jQuery bug but an IE bug. Just use <code>clone()</code></p><p>In your code to fix it that would be</p><pre class="wiki">
$("li", op.list).each(function(){
    $(this).css({position:'relative'});
    //using clone() fixes the IE problems
    op._elements[op._elements.length] = $(this).clone();
});
</pre><p>So by reducing your code and trying <code>clone()</code> you could have saved us and yourself time and nerves</p>

              <p>You're point is still inapplicable. Your argument that we've "added code just to support IE" is simply incorrect as it implies that we've provided some means that falls outside of the jQuery API. So, just like using the right tool from your toolbox for the job at hand, clone() is part of the jQuery API and serves it's purpose well.</p><p>Please try to be more respectful to those that wish to help you solve your issues. This particular issue SHOULD have been posted on forum.jquery.com, but we helped anyway.
