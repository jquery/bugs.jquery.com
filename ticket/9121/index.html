              <p>+0, Seems the full ticket proposal got truncated and the fiddle and links got cut off - I've amended the description accordingly, and taken a look at your plugin.  At the moment, it seems to have a number of shortcomings - the lack of support for delegation, for one, so it seems there's more research necessary into the problem.  I like the idea of providing a cross-browser solution to this, however - have you heard of much adoption of the plugin thus far?</p>

              <p>I know several people have commented on my blog post and I regularly direct people to it from Stack Overflow.  The plugin is the most visited page on my blog, but I only installed analytics a couple of weeks ago so there's not really enough data to say anything solid. </p><p>Telling people doesn't ''always'' work, though; there are a lot of confused individuals out there promoting events like ''keyup'' for input counters and the like.  Most jQuery plugins detecting input use ''keydown'', ''keypress'' or  ''keyup'' too. ''input'' would serve them much better, catching cutting, pasting, dropping, spell checker corrections and others.  IMO, having the event supported by jQuery would immediately increase awareness of the event, improving the quality of input detection scripts around the web.</p><p>As for delegation, it would work for the browsers that support the event natively, since it bubbles but, as for the older browsers (namely IE6-8), it would be difficult to get the event working for "future elements".  I did think about this to some extent, though, and may be able to come up with a solution based on ''focusin'' or ''mouseover'' -- when an input element receives either event it is checked against the delegate selector and <strong>then</strong> the ''input'' event is applied to the element if necessary.   </p>

              <p>That's a good point, Tim.  I believe Safari 3.0 supports ''oncut'', ''onpaste'' and drag/drop events (assuming you cancel the ''ondragstart'' event for the text box) -- all that's needed is to detect the ''bug'' where ''oninput'' doesn't fire for textarea elements.  I'll give it some thought and see if I can come up with a solution.</p><p>As for Safari 3.1 and later, you could bind to just ''textInput''. Or bind to both events and set a flag to suppress one when the other fires (depending on order of precedence).</p><p>If I get some time, I'll have a crack at a solution.</p>

              <p>Right, got a bit of time and I've come up with a proof of concept that appears to work well in all browsers:</p><p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/AndyE/sdkBs/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/AndyE/sdkBs/</a></p><p>It works by binding to all known input events on ''&lt;input&gt;'' and ''&lt;textarea&gt;'' elements, but utilizes only the most "useful" event which is usually one of the following:</p>  <ul><li>''input'' in browsers that support it (except IE9 due to the delete bug)</li>  <li>''onpropertychange'' in all versions of IE</li>  <li>''textInput'' on ''&lt;textarea&gt;'' elements in Safari &lt; 5</li></ul><p>I've tested it on ''&lt;textarea&gt;'' in Safari 3.0 and 4.05.  It works with delegate using the same method as before - binding to ''mouseover'', ''focusin'' and ''dragstart'' on the delegated element and binding to ''&lt;input&gt;'' and ''&lt;textarea&gt;'' elements that fire any of those events.  ''keydown'' might also be required for older browsers that don't support ''focusin'' - I need to do a little research to see if this is necessary. </p><p>One of the interesting advantages of this approach is that it trades in feature detection for graceful degradation - no more awkward checks in Firefox to find out if the event is supported and no more false positives from Safari &lt;5.0 on the ''&lt;textarea&gt;'' element.</p><p>If you ask me, the bugs in vendor implementations makes it all the more important that one of the major libraries normalizes this event for us.  It was introduced in HTML5 to fill an obvious deficiency in input detection and, with the influence jQuery has with web developers, including support for it will help spread the word that input detection doesn't have to stop at the keyboard.</p>
