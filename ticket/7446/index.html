              <p>Many programming style guides recommend that method names begin with a strong action verb.  As prepend is in fact jargon, it is not a strong action verb that is easily understood.  Even in this comment field the word is underlined by the browser because it does not recognize it as part of the English language.</p><p>The example given above that "Ajax isn't a 'word in any real dictionary' either" is not true, as ajax exists in nearly every English dictionary.</p><p>Its meaning is not the one usually referenced, however it is also not a method and therefor use of a strong action verb isn't recommended.</p><p>These tickets are here to make jquery a better product, not for facepalming. the bug should be valid regardless of snover's impudence and ignorance.</p>

              <p>Can't believe this showed up. Me and my buddy had a discussion about this maybe 3 years ago. In our own programming we use prefix.  Once our boss used the word prepend to describe what to do and I responded "Shouldn't I first <strong>prepopulate</strong> the data?" Of course he said he wasn't sure.</p><p>Bottom line is we try not to use words <strong>imaginitized</strong> by others, like <strong>prepopulate</strong> (just use populate), its just good <strong>strategery</strong>. We don't want jargonized words <strong>snuck</strong> into our codebase.</p><p>I get why it's wrong to use <strong>prepend</strong>, but should it be changed? Probably not, but a good lesson may be to stick to common words that can be looked up in a standard dictionary and everyone knows (not just seasoned programmers) when defining methods.  Also, stops all the squabbling.</p>

              <p>The way to make it backwards compatible is </p><p>1) Copy it to a new method called prefix</p><p>2) Mark prepend as deprecated</p><p>3) Call prefix from prepend</p>

              <p>Surely when it would be changed to "prefix" people start complaining it is not consistent with "append".</p><p>That said, if you want it yourself just add these two little lines to your file:</p><pre class="wiki">
$.fn.prefix = $.fn.prepend;
$.fn.prefixTo = $.fn.prependTo;
</pre><p>I don't think the advantages of changing it in core weigh up against the disadvantages.</p>
