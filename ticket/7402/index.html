Hi,&#92;
&#92;
I am sorry that I haven&#39;t noticed that my code did not get attached with this ticket. Actually I tried to get a xml file using ajax method in jquery. It worked fine and in IE it showed &quot;TEXTSTATUS=PARSERERROR AND TYPEERROR: OBJECT REQUIRED&quot;. So i posted this to get some help. May be posted in a wrong place (should be some where else, since I am new here I was not aware. Please let me know where I have to post this kind of help request). Anyway I solved this problem by giving this conditional statement &#92;
for data type, &quot;dataType :($.browser.msie) ? &quot;text&quot; : &quot;xml&quot;, &quot;. This solved the problem and now it is working in all the browsers. May be I am poor in English, but like jquery much and need your support for ever.&#92;
&#92;
Thanks for the time spent for this.&#92;
