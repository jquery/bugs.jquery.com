    <div class="ticket-description"><h1>Summary</h1><p>The <a href="http://api.jquery.com/event.currentTarget/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>event.currentTarget</a> documentation doesn't seem to be quite accurate for delegated events.  It says:</p><blockquote> Description:  The current DOM element within the event bubbling phase.</blockquote><p>But it seems that for delegated events, <code>currentTarget</code> is hijacked to mean "the element that matches the selector" (the selector part of the <code>.on( events [, selector] [, data] , handler(eventObject) )</code> signature).  In other words, it simulates the <code>currentTarget</code> that would exist if the listener was directly bound to the element matching the selector.</p><p>I get the impression that has been the case since <code>delegate()</code> was added in 1.4.2, for example from ticket <a href="/ticket/10563">#10563</a></p><p>There's now <code>event.delegateTarget</code>, which is really the current element within the event bubbling phase, isn't it?</p><h1>Testcase</h1><p><a href="http://jsfiddle.net/uLvy8/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/uLvy8/</a></p><p>The situation I'm describing is illustrated by the following evaluating to <code>true</code> (in FF 7 Win, Chrome 18 Win) in a delegated handler:</p><p>event.currentTarget !== event.originalEvent.currentTarget &&</p><p>event.delegateTarget === event.originalEvent.currentTarget</p><h1>Notes</h1><p>My interpretation of this is:</p><ul><li>A long time ago (1.4.2), a useful piece of data (the DOM element that matches the selector in a delegation ) was added to <code>jQuery.Event</code>, which was good.</li></ul><ul><li>The data was added by co-opting the existing DOM <code>Event.currentTarget</code> property, changing its meaning.  I'm wondering if that was as good of an idea.</li></ul><ul><li>1.7 added <code>event.delegateTarget</code> to provide (restore) access to the data that is lost as a result of <code>currentTarget</code> being co-opted to store other data.</li></ul><ul><li>Perhaps if this were being created from scratch today <code>currentTarget</code> and <code>delegateTarget</code> would be reversed, so that <code>currentTarget</code> corresponds to the element where the listener is registered (the actual current element within the bubbling phase) and <code>delegateTarget</code> corresponds to the element matching the selector.</li></ul><p>  I speculate that because, if there's going to be an additional property (<code>delegateTarget</code>) for these events to convey data above and beyond what the DOM includes, it seems to me like it would make sense to preserve the meaning of the existing property, <code>currentTarget</code>, and embed the new information in the new, non-standard property.</p><p>  But, I imagine it's either intentional (?), or too late to change the meaning of <code>currentTarget</code> for delegated events anyway.  In any case, it would be good for the <code>currentTarget</code> documentation and other relevant parts to accurately describe the situation.</p><p>As an aside, where the <a href="http://api.jquery.com/on/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span><code>.on()</code> documentation</a> says:</p><blockquote> jQuery passes the handler an event object it can use to analyze and change the status of the event. This object is a *normalized subset* of data provided by the browser;</blockquote><p>With the addition of things like <code>delegateTarget</code> (and in some cases other things, like <code>currentTarget</code>), it's not strictly true that the event object is a subset of data provided by the browser.  I guess to be really accurate it could say something like "includes a *normalized subset* of data included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events/#interface-Event" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>W3C DOM Event interface</a>, as well as additional data provided by the browser and / or jQuery".</p></div>

              <blockquote> I think the reason <code>event.currentTarget</code> was munged was so that <code>.live()</code> and <code>.bind()</code> would be equivalent from the view of the event handler.</blockquote><p>Ok, thanks for the background.</p><blockquote> Really it hardly matters since I bet 98% of people use <code>this</code> instead of <code>event.currentTarget</code>.</blockquote><p>&gt;</p><blockquote> If we were starting again then yes, it would make sense to leave currentTarget alone and make people look at delegateTarget.</blockquote><p>Perhaps most people do mostly use <code>this</code>.  If it's that prevalent, then it does sound like there would have been little downside to requiring people to use <code>delegateTarget</code> in that case, unless it's considered essential that <code>currentTarget === this</code> when <code>this</code> is a DOM object.</p><p>I often write in an OO fashion and use <code>$.proxy()</code> or some other mechanism for making <code>this</code> in my listeners refer to my own objects.  This is beside your point, just an aside about my personal usage.</p><p>In general, using <code>this</code> for this purpose seems like kind of a waste since the data it would refer to is accessible via the other variables (<code>target</code>, <code>currentTarget</code>, <code>delegateTarget</code>) and <code>this</code> can be put to a more useful purpose.  Not that I expect that to change, I'm just saying.</p><p>The amount of <code>this</code> usage may decline if things like Backbone catch on, which encourages setting up event handling in a way that binds <code>this</code> to its view objects in the listeners.</p><blockquote> But given that several years have gone by we are likely to break someone's code. There isn't a lot of reason to do that.</blockquote><p>Yeah, I figured there's no way it can be changed now, unfortunately.</p><blockquote> For most people's view it's a normalized subset, the importance of saying subset there is that many people seem to expect every property of the native event object to be present in the jQuery one.</blockquote><p>Right.  Well maybe it would make sense to just change it to "This object includes a normalized subset...".  I guess it's a technicality though.</p><blockquote> Given that information, what action do you think needs to be taken to close this ticket?</blockquote><p>I think the <code>event.currentTarget</code> documentation should be updated to explain exactly what data it will contain in various situations (directly bound and delegated events) and clarify that it isn't necessarily the current element in the bubbling phase and not necessarily the same as the <code>currentTarget</code> value of the native event object.  Also, explain that <code>delegateTarget</code> may contain what you might expect <code>currentTarget</code> to, and when it will.</p><p>I don't know what's involved in submitting a patch for the documentation or if I'll have time to figure it out, but if I wrote some new copy, might that be accepted and added to the docs by someone who already knows how?</p><p>I could submit a new ticket if I notice other areas of the documentation that could use clarification on this issue and this ticket is closed by then.</p><p>Thanks</p>

              <blockquote> Are there situations where the current variables cannot provide the information you need?</blockquote><p>No, the data is available with current variables in 1.7+ now that <code>delegateTarget</code> has been added.  To me it just seems like an undesirable outcome that the new, non-standard property (<code>delegateTarget</code>) -- and not <code>currentTarget</code> -- is what corresponds to the standard <code>currentTarget</code>.</p><p>In hindsight it seems like the decision to use <code>currentTarget</code> like this maybe wasn't ideal, and perhaps there was a missed opportunity to straighten it out when <code>on()</code> and <code>delegateTarget</code> were introduced.  If it's too late to straighten out now, that's that.  If it's not too late, would it not make sense to seize the opportunity to get <code>currentTarget</code> back on track, mirroring the standard property of the same name, once and for all, and have <code>delegateTarget</code> contain the data that's overlaid on the DOM?</p><p>As I mentioned, the treatment of <code>currentTarget</code>, diverging from the DOM, has not actually been documented, at least not in the <code>currentTarget</code> entry.</p><blockquote> This has not been a point of confusion.</blockquote><p>I can't speak for anyone else, but it was a source of confusion for me when the documentation says <code>currentTarget</code>, which has the same name as a standard DOM property, is "the current DOM element within the event bubbling phase" and it's not really.  But if 98% of people use <code>this</code> and not <code>currentTarget</code>, then I'm not too surprised it hasn't been on the radar.</p>

              <p>Understood, which is why I was only floating the idea of changing it for listeners registered with <code>on()</code>.  However, as a developer it's dangerous to rely on undocumented behavior.  The current docs describe the standard meaning of <code>currentTarget</code>, not the actual treatment in jQuery:</p><blockquote> The current DOM element within the event bubbling phase.</blockquote><p>It makes no distinction between direct and delegated registrations.</p><p>If the issue is backward compatibility, that seems relevant to me.  If it's intentional that <code>currentTarget</code> be coerced this way because on balance it's considered more useful than preserving the standard meaning, that's a different story.</p><p>Anyway, if the official position of jQuery is that it's not changing, the last paragraph of my previous post sums it up for me. </p>
