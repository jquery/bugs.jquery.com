              <p>I narrowed this problem down as far as I could.  First, I reset all of my IE security levels to default and cleared my cache and cookies.  I also disabled ALL of my add-ons.  I have IE version 7.0.5730.11, BTW. Next, I stripped down my HTML file until all I had was a bare bones HTML file with an include of jquery-1.3.1.js. Then, I started going through jquery and ripping out code until I hit the following line:</p><p>div.innerHTML = '   &lt;link/&gt;&lt;table&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;a href="/a" style="color:red;float:left;opacity:.5;"&gt;a&lt;/a&gt;&lt;select&gt;&lt;option&gt;text&lt;/option&gt;&lt;/select&gt;&lt;object&gt;&lt;param/&gt;&lt;/object&gt;';</p><p>If I take that line out, in particular if I take out the "&lt;object&gt;&lt;param/&gt;&lt;/object&gt;" part at the end, then the warning message goes away.</p><p>So, finally, I brought up regedit and did a search for "VFW".  Sure enough there were numerous references to DLLs with "vfw" in the name and a "vfw" file extension type. These all related to MPEG codecs, Microsoft Video, Quicktime, a video camera I have, etc.  Why the object tag and IE7 are picking on VFW, I don't know.  Anyway, that's the problem.  I don't understand what the point of that code in jQuery is, but maybe it can be removed or recoded.</p>

              <p>Thanks for doing the extra investigation on this. </p><p>The code that you mention is part of the new jQuery.support code for 1.3 I am not sure why it is only happening for your setup and not reported (yet) by anyone else. Have you tried any other systems with IE7 to see if they show the problem?</p><p>Also, is this a local intranet site, for example a localhost? Or is it a public Internet site? </p>

              <p>Both of the sites mentioned previously (dev.pcnvchamber.org and www.pcnvchamber.org) are public.</p><p>I have not tried this against another machine with ie7.  Almost all of the computers I have either run linux or Mac OS. I suspect this is an edge case related to software I have installed.  In particular, I suspect it may have something to do with a Creative Labs computer video camera I have installed.  I will try uninstalling the software for this to see if the problem goes away.</p>

              <p>Okay, now the only question left is why </p><pre class="wiki">&lt;object&gt;&lt;param/&gt;&lt;/object&gt;</pre> would try to open that property page. It seems like it must be a bug in the Creative webcam driver, most likely the entries it puts into the registry.

              <p>This is an important issue for me, so I did a bit of research.</p><p>Repro is easy: deactivate ActiveX in IE options and include jQuery 1.3.* (tested with 1.3.1 and 1.3.2) on your page. Yellow blocking bar appears.</p><p>dmethvin has spoted the issue right on. The jQuery.support code testing browser features include a "&lt;object&gt;&lt;param /&gt;&lt;/object&gt;" part, which is what makes IE tickle.</p><p>I had to find a workaround, so I removed that &lt;object&gt; part, and set the correponding support feature (objectAll) to false. Bug solved on my site.</p><p>This is probably not a good fix for everyone since I don't really understand the consequences of doing so, though. Although I searched for references to objectAll but didn't find any... My application doesn't use any object tag, so I don't really care about this.</p>

              <p>I had the same issue on 3 different systems: IE 6 on Windows Server 2003, IE 7 on Windows XP and Windows Vista.
