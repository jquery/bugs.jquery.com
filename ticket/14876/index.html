It turns out that this switch:</p><pre class="wiki">


jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr = 
  window.ActiveXObject !== undefined ?
	function() {
		return !this.isLocal &&
/^(get|post|head|put|delete|options)$/i.test( this.type ) &&
createStandardXHR() || createActiveXHR();} :
	createStandardXHR;

</pre><p>is not enough. You have to know if the <strong>resource being opened</strong> is local or not. </p><p>My solution is to add that check:</p><pre class="wiki">
return (!this.isLocal || this.url == document.location || this.url.indexOf("http") == 0) &&
...
</pre><p>The check for this.url being document.location is necessary for my application (local version of <a href="http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/test2.htm)," class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/jsmol/test2.htm),</a> but I am not sure why. </p><p>Bob Hanson</p><p>Principal Developer, Jmol</p></div>

              <p>I do apologize for not using jsFiddle. I am not familiar with jsFiddle, and since this is a local-only MSIE problem, I didn't think of that. </p><p>Now that I have done more thorough testing, I see that the problem is more complicated. All versions of jQuery - 1.10.2, 1.11.0, and 2.1.0 - fail in one way or another.</p><p>The test files are in <a href="http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/test," class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://chemapps.stolaf.edu/jmol/test,</a> and you will have to download them and run them locally with MSIE 11 to see the problem. </p><p>There are four tests there. The first two are asynchronous, and the second two are synchronous. Tests 1 and 3 test remote access via AJAX from a local page; tests 2 and 4 test local access of local files.</p><p>I provide a working patched version of jQuery-1.11.0.</p><p>In summary:</p><p>Without the above patch, </p><p>jQuery 1.10.2 -- local-reading tests (2 and 4) fail in MSIE local</p><p>jQuery 1.11.0 -- remote-reading tests (1 and 3) fail in MSIE local</p><p>jQuery 2.1.0 -- local-reading tests (2 and 4) fail in MSIE local </p><p>It all has to do with MSIE still requiring the <a href="/wiki/ActiveXObject">ActiveXObject</a>, but only for local file reading of local pages. I think I have that right.</p><p>Let me know if you have any questions.</p><p>Bob Hanson</p>

              <p>All fail regardless of the setting of isLocal.</p><p>1.10.2 is still broken because it doesn't check for isLocal.</p><p>1.11.0 does not actually pass the user's isLocal setting to the method, so that still fails. I guess "this" isn't what you think it is. I don't see it, but it has something to do with ajaxSettings not being a function, and options.xhr() not being a prototype function.</p><p>2.1.0, as far as I can tell, doesn't even include <a href="/wiki/ActiveXObject">ActiveXObject</a>, and isLocal is never tested, so it fails.</p>

              <p>Thank you for looking into 11.1. I would like to tell my users that they can provide that if they want to and are not forced to use my hacked version. </p><p>-- unsolicited comment follows --</p><p>As long as it is made clear to developers that jQuery 2.x does not support MSIE 11 fully, I suppose this is not an issue. Seems a bit extreme of a position to take to me, to simply not even consider the option of using <a href="/wiki/ActiveXObject">ActiveXObject</a>. I would think the reason for that was the ''belief'' that it was no longer necessary with MSIE 11, but clearly it is necessary, for whatever reason, so I suggest reconsidering that position and perhaps not being so hasty to jettison a piece that is still important in the latest release of a popular browser. It seems to me that the attempt to fix the problem with this.isLocal shows that people do care about this, though it was not implemented correctly and apparently not tested fully. </p><p>And the fix is so simple. </p><p>My 2 cents.</p>

              <p>Exactly. And I consider it a hack. I've done what I can do -- provide simple cases in point, provided a work-around that works for me, suggested a reason why it the current code is bound to fail, and pointed out a design flaw in 2.1.

              <p>Feel free to own it. You have to download the file; you might as well edit it as well.
