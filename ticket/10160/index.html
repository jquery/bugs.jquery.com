              <p>Timmywil, I think maybe my bug report was not very clear. The issue is that errors are not getting reported in the console. Please can you recheck this. I have tried this on 3 machines and have asked others to confirm what I am receiving...</p><p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7243098/errors-in-jquery-ajax-are-not-getting-reported" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7243098/errors-in-jquery-ajax-are-not-getting-reported</a></p><p>It seems clear that this issue does exist.</p><p>I understand the attraction of jsfiddle but, in this case, I think its best to use the direct code (as the bug may be due to an interaction with the browser). I.e its best to keep the javascript and the environment the same so the bug can be reproduced reliably (eg lack of an error console on jsfiddle and not being sure if firebug-lite will behave just like firebug etc). </p><p>I dont know if this is a bug or its there by necessity - in which case the bug is really a request for a warning in the documentation as I've spent a lot of time trying to resolve this.</p><p>There is a link to the web page here...</p><p><a href="http://www.alisonstrachan.co.uk/tests/ajax2/ajax_test2.html" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://www.alisonstrachan.co.uk/tests/ajax2/ajax_test2.html</a></p><p>Run this and if you dont receive an error in the error console - then you have reproduced the issue.  </p><p>I have tried to use the Edge version of jQuery but I cant find the link for it (sorry dont know how to use git).</p>

                      <span class="change-field-old">@macrae_dj: I see no reason why you should not be able to reproduce the issue on jsfiddle unless php is required (in that case, it is usually an issue with the server side code and not jQuery).  jsfiddle is a normalized environment where we can make proper assumptions. If the issue cannot be reproduced there, it is probably not an issue with jQuery.  A test page on your own server does not really help because we need something editable and we need to rule out user error.&#92;
&#92;
PS- you can link the git version of jquery here: http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js&#92;
PSS - jsfiddle is like any other webpage in that it will log to the existing browser console if it exists.  Firebug lite is not required and something to keep in mind is that regular firebug will override it and take over logging whether lite is present or not.  To see the test page created on jsfiddle by itself, you can add /show to the end of url.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1314716266961471</span>

              <p>@macrae_dj: I see no reason why you should not be able to reproduce the issue on jsfiddle unless php is required (in that case, it is usually an issue with the server side code and not jQuery).  jsfiddle is a normalized environment where we can make proper assumptions. If the issue cannot be reproduced there, it is probably not an issue with jQuery.  A test page on your own server does not really help because we need something editable and we need to rule out user error.</p><p>PS- you can link tothe git version of jquery here: <a href="http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://code.jquery.com/jquery-git.js</a></p><p>PSS - jsfiddle is like any other webpage in that it will log to the existing browser console if it exists.  Firebug lite is not required and something to keep in mind is that regular firebug will override it and take over logging whether lite is present or not.  To see the test page created on jsfiddle by itself, you can add /show to the end of url.</p>

Its just that I had other folk test with this link and they reported that no error message was received. If you do get an error message, can you let me know the details of you firefox version etc just in case this is has some bearing on the issue.</p>

              <p>No, I did not. In the first file, the result I saw was that no error was reported (as your original filing states) - but that link is irrelevant because it uses an outdated version of the lib and an intentionally broken behaviour (async:false allows users to break the "asynchronous" design of XMLHttpRequest)</p>

I have experimented with Timmy&#39;s jsfiddler link and ...&#92;
&#92;
with async I get no error message,&#92;

with sync I do get the error message.&#92;
&#92;
[http://www.alisonstrachan.co.uk/tests/ajax2/ajax2_async_false.jpg]&#92;
&#92;
I.e. for me, the bug seems to be present with async operation (can you try this also and see what you get).&#92;
&#92;
It seems like the bug is intermittent/depends on other platform factors etc. Tricky.&#92;
&#92;
I&#39;m a bit worried about what you say about the &#39;sync&#39; behaviour. In my application, I need one ajax request to complete before the next one starts (its not a publicaly available web page, but a script I run locally). I can adjust my own javascript to accomplish this and use the async ajax. But that&#39;s not the issue, if a feature is available you should be able to use it or at the very least there should be some warnings about it!&#92;

I read this and was OK with this. This is not a problem for me. This is not the problem we are experiencing here.&#92;

Anyway back to the bug. I&#39;ve tried it on Internet Explorer, and I get an error reported for both async and sync but the message pop-up is different for each. Does this help explain my Firefox is missing some errors...&#92;
