              <p>The list is good but I'd also like to propose a more drastic change (it might not be implemented but I still think we should at least put that out) - it's what Gibson said amongst others - to at least create an alternative way of defining the map & source files - a site would be declaring a link to the manifest file in its HTML, like:</p><p>    &lt;link rel="sourcemaps" href="path/to/manifest.json"&gt;</p><p>The manifest file would be a JSON with mappings in a format like:</p><p>    "path/to/jquery-2.1.0.min.js": [ "path/to/jquery-2.1.0.min.map", "path/to/jquery-2.1.0.js" ]</p><p>The site would then download the map & source files for minified files on opening <a href="/wiki/DevTools">DevTools</a> or on debugging start. The map file should not reference the minified file by name but can do it e.g. via an md5 hash (thx Gibson for the suggestion). The map file would also declare the path (full or relative) to the source file.</p><p>In this way we achieve a very important thing - a developer that either doesn't know about sourcemaps or doesn't care about it could copy the files they want and the new site just wouldn't have source map functioning but no errors would be caused by that - since the manifest is missing, <a href="/wiki/DevTools">DevTools</a> wouldn't even try to find sourcemap files.</p><p>Another problem was mentioned by Dave during a meeting: current sourcemap spec breaks one important assumption - that vendor minified files can have clearly defined md5/sha1/etc. hash that lets people quickly check if their vendor file isn't hijacked in any way. Putting comments that depend on file names in the minified file breaks that assumption, a manifest approach avoids this problem completely.</p><p>To the list of wins of the approach with the manifest file is also a slight size saving for end users since they download the file without comments that are interested only to devs that do debugging.</p><p>Thoughts?</p>

              <p>Has anyone opened a bug at crbug.com on Chrome's unwanted behaviour?  Someone prolly thought this was a great feature; it would still be useful, if I was debugging problems with my sourcemaps or something, but otherwise, you don't want to see those 404's.  I'd ask to make the default "quiet" with an option to log the "warnings".</p><p>Also, consider embedding the original source in the sourcemap file, in which case you only need the min.js and map file to debug.
