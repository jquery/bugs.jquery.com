&#92;
So I looked for information, and I successively found 2 contradictory advices in jQuery documentation!&#92;
- in dblclick() page is advised not to use the 2 events on the same element&#92;
- in bind() page is presented an example of this double use&#92;
&#92;
I then investigated, and I seem having understood where the problem lies, and found a simple method to get it working always properly.&#92;
&#92;
So I think that jQuery could integrate the involved mechanism to automatically apply it as soon as a it sees that the 2 events are bound on the same element.&#92;

              <p>Re comment <a href="/ticket/2">#2</a>, that is a bug and has already been filed/fixed for 1.5.2.</p><p>I agree we're giving contradictory information, the example in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/bind/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://api.jquery.com/bind/</a> does attach both handlers even though the text in <a href="http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://api.jquery.com/dblclick/</a> warns about cross-browser issues. I do not think this is something worth normalizing, but if you would like to propose a solution (perhaps initially in a plugin) we could consider it.</p>

              <p>For the time-being, I've updated .bind() to reflect a similar note to the one we've included on dblclick and added a reference to the example that uses them. We should however consider (imo) dropping the example that binds both handlers as it doesn't really make sense to tell people not do something then show an example that contradicts this :) <a href="http://api.jquery.com/bind/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://api.jquery.com/bind/</a></p>
