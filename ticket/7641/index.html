              <p>Using jQuery 1.5.2. Not only does animating the height/width of an element to "auto" not work, but it causes a <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> error in IE 7 and IE 8. I don't mind that it doesn't work (I'm really just passing it through as a dummy value), but it'd be nice if it didn't throw an error.</p><p>Could it work? It doesn't seem like it'd be too hard to figure out what the, e.g., height of an element would be if no styles were applied to it modifying its height, which is exactly what the "auto" property is. Am I wrong?</p>

              <p>+0, If this doesn't take a lot of bytes I'm fer it, otherwise I'm agin' it. Animating things set to <code>auto</code> naturally raises a flag with me, sorry that some people expect it to work somehow.</p>

              <p>@mikesherov My current patch has nothing to do with the code posted when the bug was opened. It doesn't involve cloning elements anymore, see <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/515" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>https://github.com/jquery/jquery/pull/515</a></p><p>@jaubourg The proposed patch adds exactly 58B to jquery minified and compressed</p><p>It saddens me to see some "-1" without any explanation. I wish I could understand and maybe answer your concerns.</p>
