              <p>I'm sorry... I thought that jQuery's prime goal was to provide a cross-browser library that saved developers the hassle of having to account for browser bugs...?</p><p>I'm aware that you probably never tested v2.0 on FF 3.6 and didn't know it failed loading completely until now, and that's why I created this bug report.</p><p>Yes, I can accept that jQuery 2.0+ is for modern browsers only, and as much as I'd like to say that Firefox 3.6 is 'only' 2 years old and a year younger than IE8, as much as I'd like to point out that some companies still bundle VMs with Firefox 3.6 in it to their consultants (Oracle comes to mind...), the reality is that it uses an older <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> engine and is bothersome, and these developers can stick to jQ 1.9.</p><p>I'm okay with a site looking ugly for users of old browsers (which still are a few percents of my users, IE6/7/Firefox&lt;4/Safari&lt;5 included), but not with JS functionality being disabled. This is why I started using jQuery in the first place: to be able to dispense with testing the <a href="/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> thoroughly on every single browser.</p><p>The release of jQuery 2.0 is good news, because we could simply provide a different version of jQuery depending on the current browser (a cleaner, tighter one for modern browsers, a more convoluted, bigger one for oldIE). So, my code had $version = we::is('ie[-8]') ? '1.9.0' : '2.0.0b1', which should be easy enough to understand. But the jQuery blog does NOT mention that other older browsers were dropped. After confirming that Firefox 4 ran jQuery just fine, I had to change my code to we::is('ie[-8],firefox[-3.6]').</p><p>So, yes, at the minimum, I'd appreciate that the jQuery team updates the browser compatibility tables saying precisely whether the software will fail *loading at all* on an older browser. Would also be good to announce such things on the blog.</p><p>For your information, I managed to make Firefox 3.6 run jQ 2.0 by changing just four lines. My select box works, and it's a rather complex custom piece of code, but full FF3.6 compat might need more work. Is it worth it? I don't know. I don't think so. I'm just posting the diff patch for those interested.</p><p><a href="http://wedge.org/files/ff36.patch" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://wedge.org/files/ff36.patch</a></p>

              <blockquote>  But the jQuery blog does NOT mention that other older browsers were dropped. </blockquote><p>That's because, except for IE which updates VERY slowly, our policy has been to support the current and previous major version. Older versions may work but we are not actively testing them. </p><blockquote> For your information, I managed to make Firefox 3.6 run jQ 2.0 by changing just four lines.</blockquote><p>Supporting Firefox 3.6 is more than just taking this patch and applying it. We would need to add that browser to our ongoing unit tests to ensure that we don't break anything, and our future changes would be constrained by its lack of ES5 features like <code>Object.defineProperty</code>. We're not going to do that, it's a very old browser. If you need Firefox 3.6 support, use an older version.</p>

              <blockquote> If you need Firefox 3.6 support, use an older version.</blockquote><p>Which version would you suggest? If it's 1.9 then it's all fine (just ensure you point out in the blog that non-IE browsers are not always supported either in 2.0?). It would make sense that if the team ensures 1.9 always works in IE6, it also works in older versions of a much better browser. Don't forget that we can't mix 'proper' jQuery 1.9 code (.on, .done...) with older jQuery code (.bind, older Ajax behaviors...) When I made the jump last week, it took me several days of work and I'm not going to revert it. Wouldn't want to, either. Plus, as you can see, sticking to the latest beta also allows me to report bugs as I find them, and I'm of the adventurous kind.</p><p>I'll close my case by repeating that one of jQuery's original goals was to set developers free from old browser quirks. And in that respect, it has brilliantly fulfilled its mission; my software runs perfectly in Firefox 3.6 so far. Going for the 1.9/2.0 route was a decision that followed in its footsteps: keeping support for old versions while having the freedom to write a more consistent codebase, free of hacks, for modern browsers. I accomodated for this by adding a second path for old browsers. Hopefully this is going to be helpful, and useful, in the long run..?</p>

              <p>I agree with Nao. You are maintaining 1.9 for old versions of IE and 2.x for newer browsers. You should at least add FF 3.6 support to 1.9 (because developers can't provide two code bases for every script, one with support for 2.0 and the other for old versions including FF)!</p>

              <p>Firefox 3.6 and IE 6 have essentially the same support. They work "as is" in 1.9 and bug fixes will be considered on a case by case basis. Bug fixes for either will not be considered for 2.x.</p>

My select box works, and it's a rather complex custom piece of code, but full FF3.6 compat might need more work. Is it worth it? I don't know. I don't think so. I'm just posting the diff patch for those interested.  <a href="http://wedge.org/files/ff36.patch" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://wedge.org/files/ff36.patch</a></blockquote><p>Good news: most of those changes will be in the official release of jQuery 2.0 because they are required for <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/fb0f2952929fbe0e8a39da8c7865a397c7e74835" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>QtWebKit support</a>.

That being said, Firefox 3.6 probably enjoys 95%+ support and you're probably safe to rely upon it as long as everything is well-tested.</p>

Meaning that if you're using a dynamic language, you can sniff the browser (depending whether or not you're open to such a 'horrible act', personally I'm just fine with it), then echo the Google/jQuery/MS CDN link and change the version number according to the browser being used.

To me, 0.68% still means I'm going to get Firefox 3.6 every other day, and there's a chance that one of these users is going to complain that 'my site doesn't work' (if they manage to actually post with JS disabled... ;))</p><p>Then again, it hasn't happened to me since I switched my site to use dual 1.9/2.0, so I guess there's not much to worry about.</p><p>@gibson&gt; Oh, that's a bugger... Hopefully it won't waste too many bytes. I don't think I'll be adding a shim just for Firefox 3.6 though... Even if only echoing it on that browser. Thanks for the hint, though!

              <p>Ah, thanks for identifying the disconnect there Nao.  As others have pointed out, we technically "dropped support" for FF3.6 around the time 1.8 came out. (When 1.7 came out, FF4 had just come out, IIRC. By the time 1.8 came out, FF 12 was the current version.) So that's why it wasn't mentioned in any blog posts wrt to 1.9.</p><p>However, your point about the Current - 1 version is well taken, so I've added a note to the browser support page that should make it clearer what we mean. <a href="https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/commit/30ecd81475659fae02cea6a6159b33b5c12a9496" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>https://github.com/jquery/jquery.com/commit/30ecd81475659fae02cea6a6159b33b5c12a9496</a></p>
