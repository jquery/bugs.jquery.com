    <h5 class="ticket-description-title">Description</h5>
    <div class="ticket-description"><p>There seem to se a problem with jQuery initialization which breaks the key binding event model in Safari for Windows (v 5.1.7). We found this using jQuery together with <a href="/bugs.jquery.com/wiki/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>.net component which works based on input to hidden textarea field, and didn't properly consume the space key (every other space key press was handled).</p><p>We were able to track this down to the following code lines:</p><pre class="wiki">
1621: div.innerHTML = "&lt;div style='width:5px;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";

1626: div.innerHTML = html;
</pre><p>It seems that Safari doesn't like further DOM manipulation to existing structure within this life cycle event.</p><p>We were able to fix this by creating new elements for further processing:</p><pre class="wiki">
  /* CMS */
  // Fix for Safari vs. CodeMirror
  div = document.createElement("div");
  container.appendChild(div);
  /* CMS end */
  div.innerHTML = "&lt;div style='width:5px;'&gt;&lt;/div&gt;";

  support.shrinkWrapBlocks = (div.offsetWidth !== 3);
}

/* CMS */
// Fix for Safari vs. CodeMirror
div = document.createElement("div");
container.appendChild(div);
/* CMS end */
div.style.cssText = positionTopLeftWidthHeight + paddingMarginBorderVisibility;
div.innerHTML = html;
</pre><p>Please advise whether our fix is correct or may cause unwanted behavior.</p><p>Thank you</p><p>Martin Hejtmanek, CTO</p><p>Kentico software</p></div>

We already spent several hours in finding solution and provided you with exact code that fixes the issue and we are not willing to spend more time on making some minimalistic sample. Yes, it is probably caused by the complexity of our product but you have all you need to fix it. It is now up to you whether you are willing to spend your time on fixing your own product or wait until someone else reports it and spend the same hours as we did on finding that it is the very same issue after all ;-) </p>

It's about how we can't take action without a test case that can reproduce this issue considering the overwhelming volume of bug reports we get, and work on, in our free time. Reports from people who are unwilling to work with us, and who tell us to fix bugs in our product despite not providing any actionable steps and take umbrage when repro steps are requested, are not reports we are going to act on.</p><p>Simply, we will wait till someone can provide us actionable steps, as many people do. If there is a bug in jQuery here, someone will report it, and they'll be willing to provide repro steps. </p><p>The way we do work here is create a failing unit test first, so the same regression doesn't happen in the future. Without repro steps, we can't create a test. You have asked us if your fix is "correct". We can't even begin to answer that question until we see how and why it's breaking in the first place. Yes, the fix may cause adverse side effects. Maybe not for you. But it won't be in jQuery core unless it can be proven how it's broken.</p><p>If instead you are asking us if your fix would work for JUST you, then ask that in the forum. This is the bug tracker, where people are trying to fix issues in jQuery proper, and are expected to follow the bug reporting guidelines: </p><p>"Please follow the  bug reporting guidlines and use  jsFiddle when providing test cases and demonstrations instead of pasting the code in the ticket."</p>

              <p>Hey Martin,  </p><p>Firstly, I know reducing down bugs from a CMS is quite tricky. It's awesome that the initial report includes the fix at a micro level. </p><p>Now, for the jQuery team to fix this, there will need to be a unit test accompanying any patch, so getting something reduced that can be adapted for the test suite will be key to having a solid fix in the library.</p><p>That doesn't necessarily mean you need to do the reduction on your own, but more information about what you discovered would be extremely helpful. For example, you said "It seems that Safari doesn't like further DOM manipulation to existing structure within this life cycle event" in your original report. Can you say more? What life cycle event? What DOM manipulation are you doing?</p><p>You mentioned a hidden text-field but I don't see one in the example code you supplied. Can you describe where you're putting the hidden text field? What element are you expecting to receive the keyboard events? Can you tell us which <a href="/bugs.jquery.com/wiki/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>.net component you are using?</p><p>You reported this as a bug in Safari for Windows. Did you test it on Safari for OSX? If so, did you find that the bug was limited to Safari for Windows? Did you test it on Chrome for Windows, which uses the same rendering engine as Safari? If you haven't tested on Chrome for Windows, it would be very helpful if you could do so to help us narrow down the cause of the problem.</p><p>If you haven't tested it on Safari for OSX, it would be great if you could help us determine whether the bug is limited to Safari for Windows. Answering some of the above questions, like which lifecycle event you traced it down to and what <a href="/bugs.jquery.com/wiki/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>.net component you are using could help us in our efforts to reproduce the bug.</p>

              <p>Replying to [comment:6 mikesherov]:</p><blockquote> Replying to [comment:5 anonymous]: &gt; Replying to [comment:3 mikesherov]: &gt; &gt; We are not sure whether it is a bug in "our own product" (which you are using for your own benefit, provided for free and lovingly maintained by us), which is why we asked for a simplified test case that reproduces this issue.  &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; If you're not willing to provide one to see that this is fixed, then we WILL wait until someone else reports it and spends the same hours as you did, and who is willing to work with us on resolving this issue instead of providing us with a vague, unactionable report. &gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; I said good day. &gt;  &gt; No problem, your choice, though not at all motivational for us to report anything else in future. Also a good example of how ego makes open source projects not caring about the quality ... you should be very proud of yourself now ...  Not about quality here. It's about how we can't take action without a test case that can reproduce this issue considering the overwhelming volume of bug reports we get, and work on, in our free time. Reports from people who are unwilling to work with us, and who tell us to fix bugs in our product despite not providing any actionable steps and take umbrage when repro steps are requested, are not reports we are going to act on.  Simply, we will wait till someone can provide us actionable steps, as many people do. If there is a bug in jQuery here, someone will report it, and they'll be willing to provide repro steps.   The way we do work here is create a failing unit test first, so the same regression doesn't happen in the future. Without repro steps, we can't create a test. You have asked us if your fix is "correct". We can't even begin to answer that question until we see how and why it's breaking in the first place. Yes, the fix may cause adverse side effects. Maybe not for you. But it won't be in jQuery core unless it can be proven how it's broken.  If instead you are asking us if your fix would work for JUST you, then ask that in the forum. This is the bug tracker, where people are trying to fix issues in jQuery proper, and are expected to follow the bug reporting guidelines:   "Please follow the  bug reporting guidlines and use  jsFiddle when providing test cases and demonstrations instead of pasting the code in the ticket."</blockquote><p>The deal is I spent some volunteer time on it (if you like that saying that in every post) and I am not willing to spend more on an issue that is closed on me because I provided you with exact details about how to fix it. It is totally understandable that you have other priority things, I just think you are justifying this by the wrong means. I know it is hard to receive improvement feedback, just think sometimes about what you have written. I am not trash talking, I am just doing you favor by providing additional feedback. I have no problem to not do it if you insist you are being perfect in everything you do, the feedback serves mainly to receiver, not to sender.</p><p>Why I asked that? Because I expect that you know what the code you have written so you are more eligible to answer that question than me. This is about 10-15 lines of code that need to be examined by their author, nothing more. I am knowledgeable enough that I was able to track this to the depth of the code and fix this by myself, so I think the code author should be able to estimate the consequences of such change without the failing unit test.</p><p>How I know it is bug in your code and not our or <a href="/bugs.jquery.com/wiki/CodeMirror">CodeMirror</a>? Simply because I was able to fix it by modifying your code. I didn't touch any other code and the issue was resolved. Yes, the main reason is probably a bug in the Safari itself but similar to "hacks" for other browsers, I see the need for similar "hack" here (even that this code update doesn't actually hack anything).</p><p>If you have unit tests (an I am sure that you have a unit test for this since this code is a very basis - detection of browser capabilities), it shouldn't be a problem for you to just do the changes I mentioned and verify whether it breaks something, it would actually take you less time than thinking about reasons why it can't be done. I would suggest you try to be more open minded and thing about ways how it could be done instead. (again, this is a feedback, not trash talking ...)</p><p>As I understand it now, you think it is better to keep the bug in there for 100% of future time than have it fixed and risk that it will reappear again and have it there for less time, maybe even not reappear. I understand your decision, I just don't think it is the right one for people using it. My opinion, you don't need to be angry about it.</p><p>I also understand that a bug report like this, though including details how to fix it isn't something you want (or can based on some of your internal rules) act upon, therefore I don't plan to report anything else in this matter unless I am willing to spend additional time to provide test case for it. Your product, your rules, I totally accept it ... just saying my opinion.</p><p>I still think you product is great, that is why I am trying to help you to improve it. I just expected other, more open-minded response, maybe something more grateful that I am trying to help, instead of you being angry that you are missing something I don't plan to provide (and I started by apologizing for that).</p><p>I am sorry that I spammed your bug tracker with improper report, I simply didn't notice that you require strict bug reporting guidelines and don't act upon reprot that don't exactly follow that. I wouldn't report it in the first place if I knew it.</p><p>Have a great day and if nothing else, take all what I have written as a feedback, not as a complaint ... I wasn't complaining at all.</p><p>Martin</p>

I was just telling my honest opinion about their responses and reasons why they don't plan to act about it (which in fact were very rude and emotional), to give them feedback.

We use Safari for WIndows because in our whole history we experienced the same behavior with both of them no matter what the issue was. I just mentioned that to be precise enough in bug report.</p><p>I noticed that I didn't answer one of the previously asked questions.

I didn't take any of that personally, I just wanted to solve the case. These things happen, each of us had different expectations, it just sometimes needs some more time to figure that out.
