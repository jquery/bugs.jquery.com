              <p>The main attraction of this patch was the ability to use pointerenter/leave with event delegation in jQuery. That will be needed even with Polymer or on a browser that fully supports pointer events, since pointerenter does not bubble. </p><p>jQuery has never copied and/or normalized every property on event objects, only a small critical set. The rest should come from <code>originalEvent</code>. I don't see a problem with doing the mouse-ish properties of a pointer event since the code is there and it was trivial to activate for this case.</p>

That will be needed even with Polymer or on a browser that fully supports pointer events, since pointerenter does not bubble.   jQuery has never copied and/or normalized every property on event objects, only a small critical set. The rest should come from <code>originalEvent</code>. I don't see a problem with doing the mouse-ish properties of a pointer event since the code is there and it was trivial to activate for this case.</blockquote><p>Duly noted.</p><p>One potential downside to this though: pointer event polyfills based on jQuery's special events will have to be very careful in overriding the correct bits and pieces that jQuery already sets up internally to forward mouse-like properties and to make pointerenter/-leave work with delegation. Any ideas on how 'safe' that would be and, with regards to future compatibility, would remain?</p>

              <p>Polyfills should be happening below us, not above us. On future compat, my crystal ball is not good enough to tell what may happen but it seems like the rules wouldn't change since they are basically the same rules as for mouseenter.</p>

We hook into it and make it work in older browsers ourselves.</p><blockquote> unless in this case their pointer event polyfill is separate enough to live on its own.</blockquote><p><a href="/wiki/PointerEvents">PointerEvents</a> is its own repository, like pretty much everything in Polymer. Perhaps you haven't actually looked at how Polymer is built and are just making assumptions based on the full scope of the project?</p><blockquote> However on the subject of filesize, 6k does still seems a bit much to me.

We can also trim Polymer down since there are portions we will never use, like the dispatching and firing code. The 6k is just the size of Polymer <a href="/wiki/PointerEvents">PointerEvents</a> as is. We're well aware of the trade-offs, this wasn't a decision made on a whim.</p>
