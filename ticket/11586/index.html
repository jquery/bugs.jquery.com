              <p>OK, then, thanks for the reminder! Your post above seems to indicate you're expecting the data to be on the URL. If my post from a year ago is correct (and it seems to agree with those links) then the data should be in the entity body and not the URL. Is that what you expected? Are you seeing Firefox send it in the entity body ("POST data")?</p>

              <p>@jhancockdarwin can you quote the specific part of the RFC? My impression was that DELETE could have a body. As things stand now you can encode parameters in the URL yourself, but if we reverse it there would be no way to send a body.</p>

              <p>Except said implementations are not standard: they shouldn't break on a DELETE with a body, they simply can (and probably should) ignore said body.</p><p>All I'm saying is that the previous fix allowed DELETE requests with or without a body, which is standard compliant. The fix in this ticket specifically forbids DELETE requests with a body and doesn't add any actual feature (you could already add data to the URL manually).</p><p>I'd say the safest way is probably to keep the less restrictive approach.

              <p>Agreed, jaubourg. If I had seen the earlier ticket I wouldn't have pursued this, so I've backed it out.

              <p>I'll try to be more attentive next time. I see the ticket was created on April the 12th (my birthday) which could explain a lot ;)</p><p>I also tend to leave tickets open in case someone else would chime in, but I think it's probably a mistake and I should start closing bugs more often and pre-emptively. We can always re-open them anyway.</p><p>Sorry about my missing this one earlier btw.</p>

(Metadata belongs to the headers anyway.)<p></p><p>This is the same argument as for HTTP </p><pre class="wiki">GET</pre>. <a href="http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/rest-discuss/message/9962" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>Quoting Roy Fielding</a>:<p></p><blockquote> Yes. In other words, any HTTP request message is allowed to contain a message body, and thus must parse messages with that in mind. Server semantics for GET, however, are restricted such that a body, if any, has no semantic meaning to the request. The requirements on parsing are separate from the requirements on method semantics.  So, yes, you can send a body with GET, and no, it is never useful to do so.  This is part of the layered design of HTTP/1.1 that will become clear again once the spec is partitioned (work in progress).</blockquote><p>In contrast, </p><pre class="wiki">http://example.com/user.php?id=1</pre> is a different URI from <pre class="wiki">http://example.com/user.php?id=2</pre>, which identifies a different resource.<p></p><p>Hence, it would make much more sense to pass the data as query parameters (like </p><pre class="wiki">GET</pre> does) instead of passing them in the body.<p></p>

              <p>So I've worked my way through the entire path and I still don't know ... if a Delete request has a body, is there a way for the service code to see it?</p><p>We are designing an industry-wide REST standard and at this point have been told in order to have a single request delete multiple objects who's refIds are in a list we should:</p><p>1. Put the list as query parameters in the URL</p><p>2. Use X-HTTP-Method-Override set to Delete, in a POST, where the body contains the list and the HTTP field says it's really a delete.</p><p>3. Use a 2-step approach - send the list as a post, get back a URL and then send a delete to that URL</p><p>4. Put the list in the payload of the delete and assume the service accepts it, because most development platforms today accept it.</p><p>Unfortunately we need to standardize on one of these for all adapters, and are probably going with <a href="/ticket/4">#4</a>.  I need to know if your service platform will support that or has to be explicitly flagged.  Much thanks for any response or clarification here.</p>

              <p>So, I have to delete an object which is under the control of an optimistic locking protocol. </p><p>As you can imagine, every change on the object updates its version, and when I try to update that object I have to tell the server which version I have, so it knows that I'm dealing with the latest information before making my change, or it informs me that my object is out of date and leaves me to refresh it if I please.</p><p>So, the version shouldn't be part of the URI, because the object's identity isn't changing. I don't think it belongs in the query string, because I'm issuing updates against a specific object, not search results, so the query string shouldn't exist. I can put the version in the headers, but the headers are used by the server for routing and meta-processing and probably shouldn't be passed into the business logic. The only place left is to have the object I'm modifying sent along with the delete command. Then the server is free to use it to determine the version any way it wishes.</p><p>Or, is this all wrong? Only, I can't do this at the moment -- I have to hack the version into the meta-data somehow.</p>
