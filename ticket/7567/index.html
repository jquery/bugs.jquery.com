</pre><p>4) The inner-workings of jQuery/Sizzle are non trivial and the results you see might have to do with different browsers quirks which jQuery handles for you. By e.g. having to call certain internal functions more often then you expect it to.</p><p>5) It isn't really clear what you expect the output to be.</p><p>So unless you can show specifically that/what jQuery/Sizzle does wrong in your opinion by providing a test where the result is wrong I guess it will be unlikely that someone is going to take the time to reverseengineer what your complaint is about.</p><p>If you mean to report a "performance" issue (e.g. Opera/IE do more work then necessary when selecting stuff) you should even more go into detail where you think jQuery/Sizzle goes wrong</p>

No need to be sorry. If you could provide a clearer test case that would be great then we will further investigate the issue.</span> → <span class="change-field-new">1290185481506750</span>

              <p>Because we get so many tickets, we often need to return them to the initial reporter for more information. If that person does not reply within 14 days, the ticket will automatically be closed, and that has happened in this case.
