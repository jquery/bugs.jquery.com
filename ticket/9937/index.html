              <p>I suppose the problem can relatively easily arise on creating more sophisticated plugins, where usage of both deferreds/promises and <code>jQuery.isPlainObject</code> are combined.

              <p>You'll have no problem with Deferreds and Promises. The promise() method actually uses $.extend as a mean to attach the promise aspect onto a plain object (Deferreds and Promises are just collections of lexically-bound methods), so the behaviour is exactly as expected and changing it here will break stuff.</p><p>The jqXHR object is another story though, seeing as it has fields that are updated. So if you were to $.extend( {}, jqXHR ) before the request has completed, only the original object would get its status, statusCode and responseXXX fields updated. However, callbacks attached through the new object would still be given the original jqXHR.</p><p>So, using the extended jqXHR to retrieve fields would be a no-go but that's not really that big of an issue, given callbacks given to the extended object will receive the original jqXHR (and that's the object you should use to retrieve fields).</p><p>I dunno. Would the need be widespread enough to warrant some kind of "atomic object" registry that $.extend would look into to control if an object can be deep extended? I'm really no sure myself.</p>

Screw the &quot;atomic object&quot; crap - at least, &quot;instances&quot; with exposed states should not be plain objects :)&#92;

              <p>I ran into this problem today while trying to create a simple chain of promises. I wrap a series of functions which may or may not return a promise and execute them sequentially.</p><p>If the result is a promise, then execution of the next call in the chain is deferred until the promise resolves. Otherwise, the next method is called immediately. If an Error is returned, then the chain of execution is aborted.</p><p>Example in jsfiddle: <a href="http://jsfiddle.net/katowulf/JCED9/1/" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://jsfiddle.net/katowulf/JCED9/1/</a></p>

              <p>To clarify, there is no real method to determine if it's a Deferred or not (I could check <code>'deferred' in object</code>, but could not another jquery object have a deferred property? </p><p>Without instanceof, I'm at a bit of a loss for an effective way to determine if something is a promise/deferred.</p>

              <p>Replying to [comment:15 rwaldron]:</p><blockquote> &gt; A promise is defined as an object that has a function as the value for the property 'then'  <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A" class="ext-link"><span class="icon"></span>http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Promises/A</a></blockquote><p>That's the Promise/A way. You can also test for the presence of a promise method and call it to retrieve the promise... that way, you will also catch objects that do not implement the promise interface yet are observable through one (see $.when's code if you're curious).</p>
